### Creating a Custom Button

This procedure shows you how to create a custom button.

**Note:**

Custom buttons can be migrated to other {{ site.data.product.title }} appliances. See
[Migrating Custom Buttons](#export-import-custom-button) for guidance on migrating custom buttons to a new {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance.

{% include automate-custom-button.md %}

The button will show in the object type you added the button to.

Please note that there are two ways of creating custom buttons, and creation through the "Automation > Automate > Generic Objects" screen will necessitate adding an attribute/value pair that is not required when adding through the "Automation > Customization > Buttons" screen.
