Cockpit is an interactive Linux server administrative interface. You can perform simple administration tasks such as starting containers, storage administration, network configuration, and inspecting logs. While Cockpit allows you to monitor and administer several servers at the same time, your browser connects to a primary server that runs the Cockpit web service through which connections to additional servers can be established.

The {product-title} full administrative user interface and the Self Service user interface have enabled for users to access the Cockpit interface for a given virtual machine.
