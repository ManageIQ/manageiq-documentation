### Setting the Password for the Administrative User

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} uses a unique `admin` user to control all functions in the
web-based user interface. After installing the appliance, change the default password of the
`admin` to restrict administrative access to the appliance’s UI.

Changing the `admin` password uses the same process as changing any standard user in the appliance.

1.  Access the appliance through your web browser and log in.

2.  Click **Configuration**.

3.  In the accordion tree on the left, click on **Access Control**, then select the
    **Administrator** under the **Users** section. This displays the details for the `admin` user.

4.  On the details page, select menu: **Configuration > Edit this user** from the toolbar.

5.  Enter a new password in the **Change Password / Confirm Password** fields.

6.  Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

7.  Log out of the user interface.

8.  Test your new password by logging into the user interface. Additionally, test your new password
    in the appliance console.

The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance now has a non-default `admin` password. This
restricts access to your appliance’s administrative functions.
