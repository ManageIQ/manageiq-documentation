## Introduction to {{ site.data.product.title_short }}

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} delivers the insight, control, and automation that
enterprises need to address the challenges of managing virtual
environments. This technology enables enterprises with existing virtual
infrastructures to improve visibility and control, and those starting
virtualization deployments to build and operate a well-managed virtual
infrastructure.

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} provides the following feature sets:

  - Insight: Discovery, Monitoring, Utilization, Performance, Reporting,
    Analytic, Chargeback, and Trending.

  - Control: Security, Compliance, Alerting, and Policy-Based Resource,
    and Configuration Enforcement.

  - Automate: IT Process, Task and Event, Provisioning, and Workload
    Management and Orchestration.

  - Integrate: Systems Management, Tools and Processes, Event Consoles,
    Configuration Management Database (CMDB), Role-based Administration
    (RBA), and Web Services.

### Architecture

The diagram below describes the capabilities of {{ site.data.product.title_short }}. Its
features are designed to work together to provide robust management and
maintenance of your virtual infrastructure. ![1845](../images/1845.png)

The architecture comprises the following components:

  - The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance (appliance) which is supplied as a
    secure, high-performance, preconfigured virtual machine. It provides
    support for HTTPS communications.

  - The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} Server (Server) resides on the appliance. It is
    the software layer that communicates between the SmartProxy and the
    Virtual Management Database. It includes support for HTTPS
    communications.

  - The Virtual Management Database (VMDB) resides either on the
    appliance or another computer accessible to the appliance. It is the
    definitive source of intelligence collected about your Virtual
    Infrastructure. It also holds status information regarding appliance
    tasks.

  - The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} Console (Console) is the Web interface used to
    view and control the Server and appliance. It is consumed through
    Web 2.0 mash-ups and web services (WS Management) interfaces.

  - The SmartProxy can reside on the appliance or on an ESX Server. If
    not embedded in the Server, the SmartProxy can be deployed from the
    appliance. A SmartProxy agent must configured in each storage
    location, and must be visible to the appliance. The SmartProxy acts
    on behalf of the appliance communicating with it over HTTPS on
    standard port 443.

### Requirements

To use {{ site.data.product.title_short }}, certain virtual hardware, database, and browser
requirements must be met in your environment.

#### Virtual Hardware Requirements

The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance requires the following virtual hardware at
minimum:

  - 4 VCPUs

  - 12 GB RAM

  - 44 GB HDD + optional database disk + optional messaging disk

#### Database Requirements

Red Hat recommends allocating the virtual machine disk fully at the time
of creation. Three main factors affect the size of your database over
time:

  - Virtual Machine Count: the most important factor in the calculation
    of virtual machine database (VMDB) size over time.

  - Host Count: the number of hosts associated with the provider.

  - Storage Count: the number of individual storage elements as seen
    from the perspective of the provider or host. It is not the total
    number of virtual disks for all virtual machines.

Use the following table as a guideline to calculate minimum requirements
for your database:

![5780](../images/5780.png)

**Note:**

When enabling capacity and utilization for metrics gathering over a period of time, it is recommended that the VMDB size scale accordingly.
Evaluate the number of instances in your provider inventory and storage duration requirements to plan for increased VMDB sizing requirements.

Use the following information to plan for your increased VMDB needs when working with metrics gathering:

  - Realtime metrics data are stored for 4 hours.

  - Rollup metrics data are stored for 6 months.

**Example**:

|                                 |                        |                                                                                   |                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                                 | **Minute**             | **Hour**                                                                          | **Day**                                                                                        |
| **OpenStack Provider Instance** | **3** Realtime Metrics | **181** (3 records \* 60 minutes = 180 Realtime Metrics + 1 hourly Rollup Metric) | **4,345** (3 records \* 60 minutes \* 24 hours =4320 Realtime Metrics + 1 daily Rollup Metric) |

  - Metrics data storage times can be configured by editing the Advanced
    Settings.

#### Browser Requirements

  - One of the following web browsers:

      - Google Chrome

      - Mozilla Firefox

      - Safari

      - Internet Explorer 10 or higher

#### Additional Requirements

Additionally, the following must be configured to use {{ site.data.product.title_short }}:

  - The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance must already be installed and
    activated in your enterprise environment.

  - The SmartProxy must have visibility into the virtual machines and
    cloud instances that you want to control.

    storage and virtual machines.

  -
    The SmartProxy can be configured to reside on the {{ site.data.product.title_short }}
    appliance or on an ESX server version. The SmartProxy can be
    deployed from the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance, and provides visibility
    to the VMFS storage. Each storage location must have a SmartProxy
    with visibility to it. The SmartProxy acts on behalf of the
    {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance. If the SmartProxy is not embedded in the

    the hardware configuration, of the original virtual machine.

  - Unmanaged Virtual Machine
    Files discovered on a datastore that do not have a virtual machine
    associated with them in the VMDB. These files may be registered to a
    provider that the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server does not have configuration
    information on. Possible causes may be that the provider has not
    been discovered or that the provider has been discovered, but no
    security credentials have been provided.

  - Virtual Machine
    A software implementation of a system that functions similar to a
    physical machine. Virtual machines utilize the hardware
    infrastructure of a physical host, or a set of physical hosts, to
    provide a scalable and on-demand method of system provisioning.

  - Virtual Management Database (VMDB)

    provider or a virtual machine, showing the resource’s properties at
    a glance. Each virtual thumbnail is divided into quadrants, which
    provide information about the resource, such as its software and
    power state.

  - Worker Appliance
    A {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance dedicated to a role other than
    user interface or database.

  - Zones

    based on your environment. Zones can be based on geographic
    location, network location, or function. When first started, new
    servers are put into the default zone.
