= Creating a Real Time Performance Alert

Real Time Performance alerts enables you to be notified immediately when a performance threshold has been met for a virtual machine, host, or cluster.
Capacity and Utilization must be enabled for performance thresholds to be detected.
See the _General Configuration_ guide, available from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/, for instructions.

* From #Performance Field#, select the field to check and any other parameters required for that field. 
* In #And is Trending#, select #Don't Care# if it does not matter how the performance metric is trending.
  Otherwise, choose from the possible trending options. 
* In #Field Meets Criteria for#, select the amount of time that the threshold requires to be met to trigger the alert. 
* Set #Debug Tracing# to true only when directed to do so by Red Hat Support.
  This provides an extremely detailed level of logging and can result in many more log lines being written. 

. After setting the parameters, you then select what you want the alert to do.
  You can send an email, create an SNMP Trap, let the alert show on the timeline, or send a management event to start an automation process.
