## Examining the Provisioning Dialog

Understanding provisioning dialogs is important when working with services in
{{ site.data.product.title_short }}. Every provider in {{ site.data.product.title_short }} comes
with a sample provisioning dialog covering the options specific to that provider. The process
begins with the provisioning dialog, which presents the basic configuration options for a virtual
machine or instance. The options presented are dependent on the provider you are using. For
instance, a cloud provider might have flavors of instances, whereas an infrastructure provider
might allow you to set the memory size or number of CPUs on a virtual machine.

To see the sample provisioning dialog for Red Hat Virtualization:

1.  Browse to menu: **Automation > Automate > Customization**.

2.  Expand the **Provisioning Dialogs** accordion and select
    **Sample RedHat VM Provisioning Dialog** under **VM Provision**.

This is a textual representation of the dialog you will get when you provision a virtual machine.
