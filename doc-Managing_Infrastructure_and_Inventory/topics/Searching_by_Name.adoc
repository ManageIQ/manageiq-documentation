= Searching by Name

A search bar to the right of the taskbar on the [label]#Providers#, [label]#Clusters#, [label]#Hosts#, and [label]#Resource Pools# pages provide a method to enter names, or parts of names, for searching.
Search for items in the following ways: 

. Type characters that are included in the name.
  For example, if you type [literal]+sp1+, all names that include [literal]+sp1+ appear such as [literal]+Windows2003sp1+ and [literal]+Sp1clone+. 
. Use an asterisk ("[literal]+*+") after the desired search term to search for names that begin with specific characters.
  For example, type [literal]+v*+ to find all names that begin with the letter [literal]+v+. 
. Use an asterisk ("[literal]+*+") before the desired search term to search for names that end with specific characters.
  For example, type [literal]+*sp2+ to find all names that end with [literal]+sp2+. 
. Erase all characters from the search box to go back to viewing all virtual machines.
