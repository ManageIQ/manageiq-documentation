= Adding Azure Providers

CloudForms Management Engine now supports Microsoft Azure providers. 

[IMPORTANT]
======
Before {product-title} can be authenticated to Microsoft Azure, a series of prerequisite steps must be followed on the Azure portal; see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/[Create Active Directory application and service principal account using the Azure portal]. The link describes how to configure the Azure Active Directory (AAD), create the application your organization is developing, and also how to obtain the Tenant ID, Client ID and Client Key to add the application that will allow you to connect the Azure instance as a provider to CloudForms. In the above link, it is important to note that during *Assign Application to Role*, in step 3, select the *Contributor* role and not the *Reader* role. Note that all of these steps currently can be performed using either the Azure Resource Manager or Service Manager (Classic) mode. 
======

After a service principal account (instance of an application in a directory) has been created using the Azure portal, the following three pieces of information will be available within the Azure Active Directory (AAD) module:

* Tenant ID
* Client ID
* Client Key

You can now use the following procedure to implement the above items in CloudForms for adding an Azure cloud provider.
