# Removing Clusters

If a cluster has been decommissioned or requires troubleshooting, it
might require removal from the VMDB.

1.  Navigate to menu:Compute\[Infrastructure \> Clusters\].

2.  Check the clusters to remove.

3.  Click ![1847](/images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and then
    ![1861](/images/1861.png) (**Remove Clusters from the VMDB**).

4.  Click **OK**.

The clusters are deleted. Any virtual machines or hosts associated with
these clusters remain, but are no longer associated with them.
