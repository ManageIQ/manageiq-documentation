== Installing {product-title}

Installing {product-title} consists of the following steps:

. Downloading the appliance for your environment as a virtual machine image template.
. Setting up a virtual machine based on the appliance.
. Configuring the {product-title_short} appliance.

After you have completed all the procedures in this guide, you will have a working environment on which additional customizations and configurations can be performed.

=== Choosing the Appliance Type

There are two types of {product-title_short} appliances available to install on the VMware vSphere platform, depending on your performance needs:

* `cfme-vsphere-.w.x.y.z.x86_64.vsphere.ova` - This image uses the LSI Logic Parallel/SAS driver on vSphere.
* `cfme-vsphere-paravirtual.w.x.y.z.x86_64.vsphere.ova` - This image uses the paravirtualization (PVSCSI) driver on vSphere.

PVSCSI and LSI Logic Parallel/SAS are essentially the same when it comes to overall performance capability. However, the PVSCSI controller is more efficient in the number of host compute cycles required to process the same number of input/output operations per second (IOPS). 

If you have a storage I/O-intensive virtual machine, use the PVSCSI controller to save as many CPU cycles as possible, which can then be used by the application or host. Most modern operating systems with high I/O capability support one of these two controllers.

[[uploading-the-appliance-on-vmware-vsphere]]
=== Uploading the Appliance on VMware vSphere

Uploading the {product-title} appliance file onto VMware vSphere systems has the following requirements:

* 44 GB of space on the chosen vSphere datastore.
* 12 GB RAM.
* 4 VCPUs.
* Administrator access to the vSphere Client.
* Depending on your infrastructure, allow time for the upload.

[NOTE]
====
These are the procedural steps as of the time of writing. For more information, consult the VMware documentation.
====

Use the following procedure to upload the {product-title} appliance OVF template from your local file system using the vSphere Client.

. In the vSphere Client, select menu:File[Deploy OVF Template]. The Deploy OVF Template wizard appears.
. Specify the source location and click *Next*.
* Select *Deploy from File* to browse your file system for the OVF template, for example `cfme-vsphere-5.4-43.x86_64.vsphere.ova`.
* Select *Deploy from URL* to specify a URL to an OVF template located on the internet.
. View the *OVF Template Details* page and click *Next*.
. Select the deployment configuration from the drop-down menu and click *Next*. The option selected typically controls the memory settings, number of CPUs and reservations, and application-level configuration parameters.
. Select the host or cluster on which you want to deploy the OVF template and click *Next*.
. Select the host on which you want to run the run the {product-title} appliance, and click *Next*.
. Navigate to, and select the resource pool where you want to run the {product-title} appliance and click *Next*.
. Select a datastore to store the deployed {product-title} appliance, and click Next. Ensure to select a datastore large enough to accommodate the virtual machine and all of its virtual disk files.
. Select the disk format to store the virtual machine virtual disks, and click *Next*.
* Select *Thin Provisioned* if the storage is allocated on demand as data is written to the virtual disks.
* Select *Thick Provisioned* if all storage is immediately allocated.
. For each network specified in the OVF template, select a network by right-clicking the *Destination Network* column in your infrastructure to set up the network mapping and click *Next*.
. The *IP Allocation* page does not require any configuration changes. Leave the default settings in the *IP Allocation* page and click *Next*.
. Set the user-configurable properties and click *Next*. The properties to enter depend on the selected IP allocation scheme. For example, you are prompted for IP related information for the deployed virtual machines only in the case of a fixed IP allocation scheme.
. Review your settings and click *Finish*.

The progress of the import task appears in the vSphere Client Status panel.
