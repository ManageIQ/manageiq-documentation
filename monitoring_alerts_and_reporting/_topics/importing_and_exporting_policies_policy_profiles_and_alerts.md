### Importing and Exporting Policies, Policy Profiles, and Alerts

If you have multiple VMDBs, you can export policies, policy profiles, or
alerts from one to another. You can export and import for use with other
{{ site.data.product.title }} infrastructures.

**Note:**

The appliances you are exporting or importing data between must use the
same {{ site.data.product.title_short }} version.
