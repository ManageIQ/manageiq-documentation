= Reinstalling `ipa-client`

If you are using SSH transformation and configuring your conversion hosts for SSSD with single sign-on, you must reinstall `ipa-client` without the OpenSSH client. Otherwise, SSH will fail for the `vdsm` user. See link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1544379[BZ#1544379: ipa-client-install changes system-wide SSH configuration] for more information. This issue cannot be resolved by modifying the configuration file because the file is restored during upgrades.

. Log in to the Manager machine using SSH.
. Uninstall `ipa-client`:
+
----
# ipa-client-install --uninstall
----

. Reinstall `ipa-client` without OpenSSH:
+
----
# ipa-client-install --no-ssh
----
