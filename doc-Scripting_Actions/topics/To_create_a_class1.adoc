=== Creating a Class

. Navigate to menu:Automate[Explorer], navigate to the namespace you want to add a class to.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), then
image:../images/1862.png[image] (*Add a new Class*).

. Type in a unique *Name* and *Description*.

. If you want to use the schema from a class that has already been
created, select it from the *Inherits From* dropdown. If the class that
the new class inherits from changes, the new class will also change.

. Click *Add*.

The new class is created and you can create a schema, add instances and methods.

[NOTE]
====
For each class, create a schema if you did not choose to inherit from an
existing class. The schema can include attributes, methods, assertions,
and relationships.
