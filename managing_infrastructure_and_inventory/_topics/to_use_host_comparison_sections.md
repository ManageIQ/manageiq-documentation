# Using the Host Comparison Sections

The following procedure describes how to use the host comparison
sections.

1.  On the left of a comparison screen, select the categories of
    properties to display.

2.  Click the plus sign next to the sections name to expand it.

3.  The following descriptions pertain to the **Expanded View**
    ![2023](/images/2023.png). Either the value of a property or an icon
    representing the property displays depending on the properties type.

      - A property displayed in the same color as the base means that
        the compared host matches the base for that property.

      - A property displayed in a different color from the base means
        that the compared host does not match the base for that
        property.

4.  If you are in the **Compressed View** ![2024](/images/2024.png), the
    values of the properties do not display. All items are described by
    the icons shown below.

      - A ![2150](/images/2150.png) (**checkmark**) means the compared
        host matches the base for that property. Hover over it and the
        value of the property displays.

      - A ![2151](/images/2151.png) (**x**) means the compared host does
        not match the base for that property. Hover over it and the
        value of the property displays.

5.  Click the plus sign next to the section name to collapse it.

This comparison is viewable in multiple ways. Export the data or create
a report from your comparison for analysis using external tools.
