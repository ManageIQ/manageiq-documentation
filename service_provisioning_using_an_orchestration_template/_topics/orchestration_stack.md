## Orchestration Stacks

1.  Once the status of the provisioning request in
    **Services > Requests** is **Finished**, click
    **Compute > Clouds > Stacks** to see the deployed stack.

2.  Click the stack to see a summary of its properties, resources, among
    other details, including the running instances that are part of the
    stack. ![Catalog\_Item\_State](../images/7180.png)

You have now deployed instances and associated collection of resources
(referred to as a stack) using an orchestration template.
