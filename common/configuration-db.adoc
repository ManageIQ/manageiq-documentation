[IMPORTANT]
====
Before installing an internal database, add a disk to the infrastructure hosting your appliance. See the documentation specific to your infrastructure for instructions for adding a disk. As a storage disk usually cannot be added while a virtual machine is running, Red Hat recommends adding the disk before starting the appliance. {product-title} only supports installing of an internal VMDB on blank disks; installation will fail if the disks are not blank.
====

. Start the appliance and open a terminal console.
ifdef::login[]
. After starting the appliance, log in with a user name of `root` and the default password of `smartvm`. This displays the Bash prompt for the `root` user.
endif::login[]
ifdef::ssh[] 
. Log in to the appliance using the SSH key.
endif::ssh[] 
. Enter the `appliance_console` command. The {product-title} appliance summary screen displays.
. Press *Enter* to manually configure settings.
. Select *5) Configure Database* from the menu.
. You are prompted to create or fetch an encryption key.
* If this is the first {product-title} appliance, choose *1) Create key*.
* If this is not the first {product-title} appliance, choose *2) Fetch key from remote machine* to fetch the key from the first appliance. For worker and multi-region setups, use this option to copy key from another appliance. 
+
[NOTE]
====
All {product-title_short} appliances in a multi-region deployment must use the same key.
====
+
. Choose *1) Create Internal Database* for the database location.
. Choose a disk for the database. This can be either a disk you attached previously, or a partition on the current disk. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat recommends using a separate disk for the database.
====
+
If there is an unpartitioned disk attached to the virtual machine, the dialog will show options similar to the following:
+
----
1) /dev/vdb: 20480
2) Don't partition the disk 
----
+
* Enter *1* to choose `/dev/vdb` for the database location. This option creates a logical volume using this device and mounts the volume to the appliance in a location appropriate for storing the database. The default location is `/var/opt/rh/rh-postgresql95/lib/pgsql`, which can be found in the environment variable `$APPLIANCE_PG_MOUNT_POINT`.
* Enter *2* to continue without partitioning the disk. A second prompt will confirm this choice. Selecting this option results in using the root filesystem for the data directory (not advised in most cases). 
. Enter *Y* or *N* for *Should this appliance run as a standalone database server?*
* Select *Y* to configure the appliance as a database-only appliance. As a result, the appliance is configured as a basic PostgreSQL server, without a user interface. 
* Select *N* to configure the appliance with the full administrative user interface.
. When prompted, enter a unique number to create a new region.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Creating a new region destroys any existing data on the chosen database.
====
+
.  Create and confirm a password for the database.

{product-title} then configures the internal database.
