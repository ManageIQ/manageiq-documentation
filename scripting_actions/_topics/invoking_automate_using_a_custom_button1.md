### Invoking Automate using a Custom Button

Invoke an Automate model by mapping an Ansible playbook or instance from
the `/System/Process/Request` class to a custom button. Before creating
the button, you need to have an Ansible playbook service catalog item or
an instance in the `/System/Process/Request` class to map to it and a
button group to assign it to.

Create buttons for a cluster, host, datastore, provider, virtual
machines or cloud instances. When the button is clicked, the model or
playbook will be invoked for the selected item. For each of these, you
can have up to 15 buttons.
