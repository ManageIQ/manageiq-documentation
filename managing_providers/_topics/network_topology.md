# Using the Topology Widget for Network Providers

The **Topology** widget is an interactive topology graph, showing the
status and relationships between the different entities of the network
providers that {{ site.data.product.title_short }} has access to.

The topology graph includes cloud subnets, virtual machines, security
groups, floating IP addresses, cloud networks, network routers, cloud
tenants, and tags within the overall network provider environment.

Each entity in the graph displays a color indication of its status:
green indicates an active entity, while red indicates inactivity or an
issue.
