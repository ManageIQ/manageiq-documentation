= Setting the Root Password on the Appliance

The Red Hat CloudForms Appliance is a virtual machine image that runs on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux-based operating system.
This means users can access the base operating system through SSH.
This is why it is advisable to change the default password.
Continuing to use the default password leaves the Appliance vulnerable to any user attempting to gain root access. 

Changing the [literal]+root+ password on the appliance uses the same process as changing any user password on a Linux-based system. 

.Procedure: Changing the root Password
. Access your appliance through SSH as the [literal]+root+ user:
+
----

[user@localhost ~]$ ssh root@10.1.1.205
----
+
Substitute [literal]+10.1.1.205+ with the address of your appliance.

. Enter the +passwd+ command, which changes the password for the current user:
+
----

[root@ ~]# passwd
----

. Enter and Confirm and new password for the [literal]+root+ user. 
+
----

Changing password for user root.
New password: ************
Confirm password: ************
----

. Log out of the appliance. 

The Red Hat CloudForms Appliance now has a non-default [literal]+root+ password.
This prevents unauthorized access to your appliance through SSH.
