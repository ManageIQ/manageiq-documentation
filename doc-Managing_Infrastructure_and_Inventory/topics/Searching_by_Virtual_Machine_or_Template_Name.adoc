= Searching for Virtual Machines or Templates

To the right of the taskbar on the #Virtual Machines# page, you can enter names or parts of names for searching.
You can search in the following ways:

* Type characters that are included in the name.
  For example, if you type `sp1`, all Virtual Machines whose names include `sp1` appear, such as `Windows2003sp1` and `Sp1clone`.
* Use `\*` at the end of a term to search for names that *begin* with specific characters.
  For example, type `v*` to find all virtual machines whose names begin with the letter `v`.
* Use `\*` at the beginning of a term to search for names that *end* with specific characters.
  For example, type `*sp2` to find all virtual machines whose names end with `sp2`.
* Erase all characters from the search box to go back to viewing all virtual machines.
