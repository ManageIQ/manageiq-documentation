==== Creating Control Policies

Create control policies by combining an event, a condition, and an
action. Plan carefully the purpose of your policy before creating it.
You can also use a scope expression that is tested immediately when the
policy is triggered by an event. If the item is out of scope, then the
policy does not continue on to the conditions, and none of the
associated actions run.

The procedure below describes how to create a control policy, its
underlying conditions, and assign its events and actions in one process.
Conditions and custom actions can be created separately as well. Those
procedures are described in later sections in conditions and actions.
Also, a description of all events is provided in events.

. Uncheck Active if you do not want this policy processed even when
assigned to a resource.

. You can enter a Scope here (You can also create a scope as part of a
condition, or not use one at all). If the host or virtual machine is not
included in the scope, no actions will be run.

. In the Notes area, add a detailed explanation of the policy.

. Click Add. You are brought to the page where you add conditions and
events to your new policy.
