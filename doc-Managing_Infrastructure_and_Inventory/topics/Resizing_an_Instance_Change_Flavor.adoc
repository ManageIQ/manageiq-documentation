{product-title} allows you to resize an existing, active instance by changing its flavor. This is only possible if your OpenStack deployment has:

* At least two Compute nodes, or with resizing to the same host enabled
* Enough capacity to support the needs of the new flavor

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that the instance will undergo a controlled shutdown when you change its flavor.

For more information about the requirements and underlying OpenStack process involved, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/instances-and-images-guide/chapter-3-virtual-machine-instances#section-resize-instance[Resize an Instance] from the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/instances-and-images-guide/instances-and-images-guide[Red Hat OpenStack Platform Instances and Images Guide].
====

To resize an instance through {product-title}:

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Clouds > Instances].
. Click the instance whose flavor you want to change. 
. Click  image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and then image:1851.png[] (*Reconfigure this Instance*).
. In the *Reconfigure Instance* section, select the new flavor you want from the *Choose Flavor* dropdown.
. Click *Submit*. Doing so will initiate the flavor change, and it might take several minutes before {product-title} verifies whether the change was successful.
