## Navigating the Self Service User Interface

The Self Service user interface has a slideout navigation menu on the left that can be minimized by clicking the menu icon (â‰¡), like in the full administrative user interface. The slideout navigation menu comprises of the following tabs:

  - **Dashboard**

  - **My Services**

  - **My Orders**

  - **Service Catalogs**

The menu bar that runs along the top of the user interface contains several options including a shopping cart, notifications feature, full administrative user interface option, and a help option. Besides that,
you can see the current logged in LDAP user, for example,
**Administrator**.

  - Shopping Cart
    Click the shopping cart icon to view services that are available to order, manage your cart as required, and order all services at one time. You can read more about the shopping cart model adopted in the
    Self Service user interface under [???](#service-catalog-tab).

  - Notifications
    The Self Service user interface has introduced a new notifications feature that displays messages generated by the system for various events, such adding services to the shopping cart, ordering
    services, provisioning, service power operations, and so on. Click the bell icon to open or close the **Notifications** drawer, which shows various notification events. You can click the double arrows
    (![Double Arrows Icon](../images/ssui_doublearrows_icon.png)) located on the upper-left of the **Notifications** drawer to expand or contract the size of the **Notifications** screen as required.

  - Administration User Interface Link Clicking the menu icon (![Administration UI icon](../images/ssui-administration-ui-icon.png)) shows the **Administration UI** link, which when clicked, takes you to the full administrative user interface login page in a new window or tab of your web browser.

  - Help
    Click the help icon to access the options to open **Documentation** and **About**. Click **About** to see information about your Self Service environment, such as the logged in user name and role, the browser details, and importantly, the Self Service user interface version number, which can be useful for support purposes.

**Note:**

The resources linked to in the help icon will be, by default, the ones listed above. System administrators can change them to other resources as required for the logged in user.

  - Role-Based Access Control
    The Self Service user interface supports role-based access control of menus and features. If you are a member of multiple user groups, you can change the acting group by navigating to ***Administrator***
    > **Change Group**, then select the new group from the available options in the list.

  - Switch Language
    Although you can set your preferred language for the user interface from the login screen itself, you can switch to a different language than what is currently set also by navigating to ***Administrator***
    > **Switch Language** within the Self Service user interface.
