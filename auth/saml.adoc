== SAML

External Authentication on the Appliance has been enhanced to support SAML.
The SAML implementation has been tested with KeyCloak 1.8.

In this guide we will cover how to manually configure an Appliance's
external authentication to work with SAML. The SAML implementation has been
tested with KeyCloak but is implemented generically using Apache's mod_auth_mellon
module and should work with other SAML Identity Providers.

The current implementation only secures the Appliance's Web administrative UI with SAML.

*Note:* The REST API and Self-Service UI do not currently support SAML.

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

The following is needed in order to enable SAML Authentication to the Appliance:

* A CentOS/RHEL 7.2 based Appliance
* A SAML Identity Provider, (e.g. KeyCloak 1.8 or Later)

[[configure-saml]]
== Configure SAML 

All SAML related certificates and keys are accessed from /etc/httpd/saml2/

First ssh to the appliance as root, then create that directory:

```
# mkdir -p /etc/httpd/saml2
```

[[apache-configuration]]
=== Apache Configuration

Copy the Apache remote user and SAML template configuration files:

```
# TEMPLATE_DIR="/opt/rh/cfme-appliance/TEMPLATE"
# cp ${TEMPLATE_DIR}/etc/httpd/conf.d/manageiq-remote-user.conf        \
    /etc/httpd/conf.d/
# cp ${TEMPLATE_DIR}/etc/httpd/conf.d/manageiq-external-auth-saml.conf \
    /etc/httpd/conf.d/
```

[[saml-configuration]]
=== SAML Configuration

Notable defaults in the _manageiq-external-auth-saml.conf_ file:

[options="header",cols="4<,3<"]
|======================================================================================
| Description                                     | Default
| *Identity Provider Files* (i.e. KeyCloak)       |
| Metadata File                                   | /etc/httpd/saml2/idp-metadata.xml
| *Service Provider Files* (i.e. mod_auth_mellon) |
| Private Key File                                | /etc/httpd/saml2/miqsp-key.key
| Certificate File                                | /etc/httpd/saml2/miqsp-cert.cert
| Metadata File                                   | /etc/httpd/saml2/miqsp-metadata.xml
|======================================================================================

Other mod_auth_mellon parameters must not be modified as the Appliance expects them
to be defined as such, i.e. End points, Protected URL, etc.

For the Service Provider files on the Appliance, these can be generated using
the mod_auth_mellon command _mellon_create_metadata.sh_ as follows:

```
# cd /etc/httpd/saml2
# /usr/libexec/mod_auth_mellon/mellon_create_metadata.sh https://<miq-appliance> https://<miq-appliance>/saml2
```

The mellon_create_metadata.sh script creates file names based on the appliance URL but
can be renamed to match the expected file names from the _manageiq-external-auth-saml.conf_ file:

```
# mv https_<miq-appliance>.key  miqsp-key.key
# mv https_<miq-appliance>.cert miqsp-cert.cert
# mv https_<miq-appliance>.xml  miqsp-metadata.xml
```

With the service provider metadata.xml file generated, the Service Provider definition
can now be defined in the Identity Provider.

For KeyCloak, a Realm can be created for one or more Appliances with individual Clients
defined one per Appliance where the Client ID is essentially the URL of the appliance.

Adding a Client in the KeyCloak ManageIQ Realm:

* Select and Import the miqsp-metadata.xml file created for mod_auth_mellon.
* Set Client ID as https://<miq-appliance{gt}
* Set Client protocol as *saml*.

The Client definition for the appliance can then be updated with the following:
[options="header"]
|=========================================================================================
| Setting                                         | Value
| Name ID Format                                  | username
| Valid Redirect URIs                             | https://<miq-appliance>/saml2/paosResponse
|                                                 | https://<miq-appliance>/saml2/postResponse
| Base URL                                        | https://<miq-appliance>/
| Master SAML Processing URL                      | https://<miq-appliance>/saml2
| Assertion Consumer Service POST Binding URL     | https://<miq-appliance>/saml2/postResponse
| Assertion Consumer Service Redirect Binding URL | https://<miq-appliance>/saml2/postResponse
| Logout Service Redirect Binding URL             | https://<miq-appliance>/saml2/logout
|=========================================================================================

The Identity Provider's Metadata file idp-metadata.xml can then be obtained as follows:

```
# cd /etc/httpd/saml2
# curl -s -o idp-metadata.xml \
    http://<keycloak-server>:8080/auth/realms/<miq-realm>/protocol/saml/descriptor
```

Finally, restart Apache on the appliance as follows:

```
# systemctl restart httpd
```

[[saml-assertions]]
==== SAML Assertions

For authenticating to the appliance, the following remote user parameters are looked at by
the appliance upon a successful login and redirect from the Identity Provider.

[options="header",cols="<2,<1",width="70%"]
|==============================================
| HTTP Environment           | SAML Assertion
| REMOTE_USER                | username
| REMOTE_USER_EMAIL          | email
| REMOTE_USER_FIRSTNAME      | firstname
| REMOTE_USER_LASTNAME       | lastname
| REMOTE_USER_FULLNAME       | fullname
| REMOTE_USER_GROUPS         | groups
|==============================================

For KeyCloak, the above SAML Assertions can be created for the Appliance Client in KeyCloak as
Mappers.

[options="header",cols="6*^"]
|============================================================================================================
| Name       | Mapper Type    | Property  | Friendly Name | SAML Attribute Name | SAML Attribute Name Format
| username   | User Property  | username  | username      | username            | Basic
| email      | User Property  | email     | email         | email               | Basic
| firstname  | User Property  | firstName | firstname     | firstname           | Basic
| lastname   | User Property  | lastName  | lastname      | lastname            | Basic
|============================================================================================================

[options="header",cols="6*^"]
|============================================================================================================
| Name       | Mapper Type    | User Attribute  | Friendly Name | SAML Attribute Name | SAML Attribute Name Format
| fullname   | User Attribute | fullName        | fullname      | fullname            | Basic
|============================================================================================================

[options="header",cols="6*^"]
|============================================================================================================
| Name       | Mapper Type    | Group attribute name  | Friendly Name | SAML Attribute Name | SAML Attribute Name Format
| groups     | Group List     | groups                | groups        | groups              | Basic
|============================================================================================================

*Note:* The fullName attribute was not available in the default database as of this writing
and must be added to each user as a user attribute.

[[configure-admin-ui]]
== Configure Administrative UI 

After having configured Apache for SAML, the next step is to update the Appliance Administrative UI
to be SAML aware and function accordingly.

Login as admin, then in _Configure->Configuration->Authentication_

* Set mode to External (httpd)
* Check: _Enable Single Signon_ - With this option enabled, initial access to the Appliance Administrative UI will
redirect to the SAML Identity Provider authentication screen.  Note that logouts from the Appliance will
return the user to the Appliance login screen allowing them to login as admin unless _Disable Local Login_
is checked below.
* Check: _provider Type: _Enable SAML_ - This enables the SAML login button on the login screen, the redirects
to the SAML protected page for authentication, and supports the SAML logout process.
* Optional: Check: _Disable Local Login_ - Do this *only* if you need to disable _admin_ login to appliance and only
allow SAML based authentication.  Note that if there are issues with the Identity Provider or you need
admin access to the appliance you won't be able to login until you re-enable the Local Login
as described below.
* Check: _Get User Groups from External Authentication (httpd)_
* Click Save.

The above steps need to be done on each UI enabled appliance.

in _Configure->Configuration->Access Control_

* Make sure the user's groups are created on the Appliance and appropriate roles assigned to those groups.

[[re-enabling-local-login]]
== Re-Enabling Local Login

If the Local Login has been disabled in the Administrative UI and there is a need to be able
to login as _admin_, the Local Login can be re-enabled as follows:

=== Administrative UI:

This option is available if the Identity Provider is available and one can login using a user
with enough administrative privileges to update it:

* Login as administrative user,
* In then in _Configure->Configuration->Authentication_ uncheck _Disable Local Login_ and save.

=== Appliance Console Interface:

* ssh to the appliance as root
* Run _appliance_console_
* Select menu entry _Update External Authentication Options_
* Select _Enable Local Login_
* then _Apply updates_

=== Appliance Console CLI:

* ssh to the appliance as root
* Run _appliance_console_cli --extauth-opts_ *local_login_disabled=false*
