==== Importing, Exporting, and Resetting the Datastore

The *Automate Model* can be exported and imported as a YAML file.
{product-title} allows you to back up your model by export. Red Hat may provide you with new or updated classes, and provides an import function for either a class or the entire model. Finally, you can reset the datastore to its default. Always be sure to export the current datastore before importing or resetting.
