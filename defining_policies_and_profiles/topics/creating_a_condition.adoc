=== Creating a Condition

You can create a condition either from within a policy screen or by going directly to the expression editor in the {product-title} console. You need to define a description and an expression element. The expression element defines what criteria you want to use to
test the condition.

* Click *Find* to seek a particular value, and then check a property. For example, finding the Admin account and checking that it is enabled. Use the following check commands:
** *Check Any*: The result is true if one or more of the find results satisfy the check condition.
** *Check All*: All of the find results must match for a true result.
** *Check Count*: If the result satisfies the expression in check count, the result is true.
