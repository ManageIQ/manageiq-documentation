= Middleware Management Providers

In {product-title}, a middleware provider is a middleware management environment that you can add to a {product-title} appliance to manage and interact with the resources in that environment. This chapter describes the middleware provider that you can add to {product-title}, and how to manage them. 

The middleware provider extends {product-title_short} management capabilities to JBoss Middleware application containers running in managed virtual machines, hosts, and Linux containers. The provider delivers inventory, events, metrics, and power operations. Middleware management in {product-title_short} is a provider based on the Hawkular open source project.  When feature complete, the middleware provider will replace the current Red Hat middleware management offering, JBoss Operations Network.

== Adding a Middleware Provider

After initial installation and creation of a {product-title} environment, add a middleware provider to the appliance. 

. Navigate to menu:Middleware[Providers].
. Click  image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), then click  image:1862.png[] (*Add a New Middleware Provider*).

+
[NOTE]
====
To use SSL to authenticate the provider, the middleware management server must be started with the service option `HAWKULAR_USE_SSL=true`.
====
+
** *SSL* (SSL with validation) – Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted certificate authority. This requires that you have already configured your public and private keys in the *_/client-secrets_* directory as either two .PEM files or as a single .pkcs12 file.
** *SSL trusting custom CA*  – Authenticate the provider with a self-signed certificate.  For this option, copy your certificate’s text to the *Trusted CA Certificates* field in .PEM format.
** *SSL without validation* – Authenticate the provider insecurely (not recommended).  
** *Non-SSL*  – Select if you do not want to use SSL.
.. Enter the *Hostname* or IPv4 or IPv6 address of the machine where you installed the middleware manager.
+
