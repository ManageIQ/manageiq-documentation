These known issues exist in Red Hat CloudForms at this time:

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1225541[1225541]

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
------
At current, attempting to perform a Smart State analysis of a VMware vSphere 6 virtual machine with Virtual Disk Development Kit 6.0 returns an `Unable to determine port` error, causing the analysis to fail. This occurs because this version of the VDDK is not installed in the directory where CFME expects it. By installing `VDDK 6.0` in the appropriate directory, this is resolved.

1. Download `VDDK` 6.0 from the VMware website.
2. Copy the downloaded `GZIP` file to the `/tmp` directory on the appliance.
3. Decompress the `GZIP` archive file.
4. Prepare the `/usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib` directory:
   a. If the directory already exists, back up and remove the contents of this directory.
   b. If the directory does not exist, create it: `# mkdir /usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib`.
5. Under the decompressed archive file in the `/tmp` directory, there are several sub-directories. Copy the following directories and their contents into the `/usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib` directory:
  * `bin64`
  * `include`
  * `lib64`

This issue will be resolved in a future release of Red Hat CloudForms.

Currently, is not possible to edit tags on containers through the web user interface. This will be fixed in a future release so that editing tags on container entities no longer returns an error.

------
In the current version of CloudForms Management Engine, the SmartState analysis tasks for container images are incorrectly categorized under  "All VM Analysis Tasks". This bug will be resolved in a forthcoming version of CloudForms Management Engine by correctly categorizing smart state analysis tasks.

------
Currently, a user_id must be specified when adding a new container provider through the REST API. Specifying a user_id is not required to add a new container provider, or in the authentication process. This field and requirement will be removed in a future release.

------
In the current version of CloudForms Management Engine, any SmartState analysis errors for container images are not reported properly in the UI, these are only logged in evm.log. Additionally, the SmartState analysis task is erroneously reported to have been completed successfully. This bug will be resolved in a forthcoming version of CloudForms Management engine by reporting specific errors in the user interface for failed analysis tasks.

------
In the current version of CloudForms Management Engine, the UI only displays daily charts for monitoring container utilization, which delays the ability to monitor containers. This bug will be resolved in a forthcoming version of CloudForms Management Engine by displaying the hourly graphs if the daily graphs are not available to monitor container utilization within an hour of adding a container.

------
In the current version of CloudForms Management Engine, following a specific sequence of navigation between pods and containers Utilization pages or Timeline pages can cause the user interface to crash when displaying container details. As a workaround, reload the pages forcibly by pressing F5 when navigating between pods and containers Utilization pages or Timeline Pages. This bug will be resolved in a forthcoming version of CloudForms Management Engine by correcting the code that generates the crashes.

------
Currently, navigating from a specific pod under the Containers tab to the related service results in an error in the web user interface. This navigation issue will be fixed in a future release.

------
Docker image tags can be re-assigned to different images (for example, with a different hash identifier). However, currently the SmartState Analysis task does not verify whether the hash ID of a scanned image matches with the one of the images in the database. This will be resolved in a future release by allowing the SmartState Analysis task to identify the images by verifying the hash ID.

------
In the current version of CloudForms Management Engine, the provider link in the container provider timeline is incorrectly generated. Clicking on the link displays an error that the provider does not exist. This bug will be resolved by correcting code to generate the correct link. The provider link on the provider timeline should work as expected in the future release of CloudForms Management Engine.

------
Currently, if an inventory refresh takes place before OpenShift nodes have reported their capacity, the inventory refresh cannot process the entities. This typically happens if self-registration is disabled on the nodes, or if there are stale or unneeded nodes defined in the system. To work around this, remove the stale nodes from the system. This issue will be fixed in a future release by removing the strict requirement on the presence of node capacity.

Currently, replication of the appliance database fails after migrating from Red Hat CloudForms 5.4 to Red Hat CloudForms 5.5. The following steps resolve this issue after the migration procedure:

Disable database synchronization role on all Regional Database Appliances.

Run the following command on the Master Database Appliance:
`# psql -d vmdb_production -c "delete from host_storages"`

Run the following commands on all Regional Database Appliances, replacing <region> with the region number of the Regional Database Appliance:
`# vmdb`
`# bin/rake evm:dbsync:uninstall host_storages`
`# psql -d vmdb_production -c "drop trigger if exists rr1_hosts_storages on host_storages"`
`# psql -d vmdb_production -c "drop function if exists rr1_hosts_storages()"`
`# psql -d vmdb_production -c "delete from rr<region>_pending_changes where change_table = 'hosts_storages'"`
`# psql -d vmdb_production -c "delete from rr<region>_sync_state where table_name = 'hosts_storages'"`
`# bin/rake evm:dbsync:prepare_replication_without_sync`

Finally, enable the database synchronization role on the Regional Database Appliances.
