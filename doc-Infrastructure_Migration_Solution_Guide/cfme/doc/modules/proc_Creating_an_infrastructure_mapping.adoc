^|Screen ^|Procedure

|*General*
.<a|. Enter the infrastructure mapping name and (optional) description.
. Select the target provider from the drop-down list.
. Click *Next*.

|*Map Compute*
.<a|. Select a source cluster and a target Red Hat Virtualization cluster or OpenStack Platform project.
+
*Red Hat Virtualization only:* A target cluster that does not contain a conversion host displays a warning icon (&#65279;image:warning.png[height=15px]&#65279;). The icon appears after a few seconds' delay for polling the clusters and refreshing the UI.
. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map additional clusters.
. Click *Next*.

|*Map Storage*
.<a|. Select a source cluster from the drop-down list.
. Select a source datastore and a target Red Hat Virtualization datastore or OpenStack Platform volume type.
+
*OpenStack Platform only:* If the target datastore is missing, see xref:OpenStack_storage_not_detected[Storage not detected].)
. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map additional datastores.
. Click *Next*.

|*Map Networks*
.<a|. Select a source cluster from the drop-down list.
. Select one or more source networks and a target network.
+
*OpenStack Platform only:* IMS supports both provider and tenant networks.

. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map the networks of additional source clusters.
. Click *Create*.

|*Results*
.<a|Click *Close*. Your infrastructure mapping is saved in menu:Compute[Migration > Infrastructure Mappings].

If error messages appear, see xref:Infrastructure_mapping_errors[Infrastructure mapping errors].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you add or remove providers or provider objects from an infrastructure mapping, the mapping will have xref:Infrastructure_mapping_missing_resources[missing resource errors]. You must re-create the infrastructure mapping.
====

After you have created a successful infrastructure mapping, you can create a  xref:Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[migration plan].
