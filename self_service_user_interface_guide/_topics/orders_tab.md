## My Orders Tab

The **My Orders** tab lists all shopping cart orders which contain
service requests added from the **Service Catalog**.

Click on the tab to see a summary of each order, including the order
number, requester, order date, and the number of items. Click the arrow
next to an order number to see more details such as the requests
associated with the order, request ID, whether it is approved or denied,
and the current state of the request. You can reorder a request by
clicking the **Reorder** button, then enter the options associated with
the order, and add to shopping cart. You can click on more options
*(represented by three dots)* next to an order to **Remove** the order.
