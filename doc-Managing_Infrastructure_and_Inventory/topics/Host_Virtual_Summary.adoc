= Host Virtual Summary

Clicking on a specific host shows the Host's Virtual Thumbnail and an _operating system-sensitive_ screen of host information, called the Host Summary.
Where applicable, click on a subcategory of the Host Summary to see more detail on that section.

A [label]#Refresh# provides some basic information on the Host.
To get more detail, enter credentials for the host and perform a SmartState Analysis.

The Summary divides into the following categories.

* [label]#Properties# include information such as base operating system, hostname, IP addresses, devices attached to the system, and storage adapters.
  Some categories can be clicked on for additional detail.
  For example, click btn:[Network] to view the network adapters connected to the host.
