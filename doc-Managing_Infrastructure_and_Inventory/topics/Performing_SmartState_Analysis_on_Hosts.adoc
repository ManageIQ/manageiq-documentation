= Performing SmartState Analysis on Hosts

Perform a SmartState Analysis on a host to collect additional information about it, such as patches, CPU, and memory.
[NOTE]
====
ESX utilizes a service console for host management and can be accessed using SSH. ESXi hosts lack a service console and therefore SSH cannot be used to obtain information sets for patches, services, Linux packages, user groups, SSH Config, and FS Files 
====
[NOTE]
====
`root` or administrator credentials are required to get patch information.
