# Credentials

Credentials are utilized by {{ site.data.product.title_short }} for authentication when
running Ansible playbooks against machines, synchronizing with inventory
sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

## Adding Credentials

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} can store credentials used by playbooks. Credentials
saved in {{ site.data.product.title_short }} are matched and executed with a playbook
when run.

1.  Browse to menu: **Automation > Ansible > Credentials**.

2.  Click **Configuration**, then
    ![Add New Credential](../images/1862.png) (**Add New
    Credential**).

3.  Provide a **Name** for the credential.

4.  Select the **Credential Type**. Additional fields will appear
    depending on the type chosen.

    - **Vault Password**: Ansible Vault credentials have only the **Vault
    Password** attribute that may be configured. For more information on Ansible Vault, see [Using Vault in playbooks](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_vault.html).

5.  Click **Add**.

## Credential Types

Each credential type used by {{ site.data.product.title_short }} is detailed in the
following sections.

### Machine

Machine credentials enable {{ site.data.product.title_short }} to invoke Ansible on
hosts under your management. Just like using Ansible on the command
line, you can specify the SSH username, optionally provide a password,
an SSH key, or a key password. They define SSH and user-level privilege
escalation access for playbooks, and are used when running playbooks on
a remote host.

  - **Username**: The username to be used for SSH authentication.

  - **Password**: The actual password to be used for SSH authentication.

  - **SSH Private Key**: Copy or drag-and-drop the SSH private key for
    the machine credential.

  - **Private Key Passphrase**: If the SSH Private Key used is protected
    by a password, you can configure a Key Password for the private key.

  - **Privilege Escalation**: Specifies the type of escalation privilege
    to assign to specific users. Options include **sudo**, **su**,
    **pbrun**, **pfexec**.

  - **Privilege Escalation Username**: Enter the username to use with
    escalation privileges on the remote system.

  - **Privilege Escalation Password**: Enter the actual password to be
    used to authenticate the user via the selected privilege escalation
    type on the remote system.

### Network

Network credentials are used by Ansible networking modules to connect to
and manage networking devices.

Network credentials have several attributes that may be configured:

  - **Username**: The username to use in conjunction with the network
    device.

  - **Password**: The password to use in conjunction with the network
    device.

  - **Authorize**: Select this from the Options field to add an
    Authorize password which signs the RSA key with a password.

  - **Authorize password**: If **Authorize** is checked, enter a
    password in the **Authorize Password** field.

  - **SSH Key**: Copy or drag-and-drop the actual SSH Private Key to be
    used to authenticate the user to the network via SSH.

  - **Private key passphrase**: The actual passphrase for the private
    key to be used to authenticate the user to the network via SSH.

### SCM

SCM (source control) credentials are used with Projects to clone and
update local source code repositories from a remote revision control
system such as Git, Subversion, or Mercurial.

Source Control credentials have several attributes that may be
configured:

  - **Username**: The username to use in conjunction with the source
    control system.

  - **Password**: The password to use in conjunction with the source
    control system.

  - **Private key passphrase**: If the SSH private key used is protected
    by a passphrase, you may configure a key passphrase for the private
    key.

  - **Private Key**: Copy or drag-and-drop the actual SSH Private Key to
    be used to authenticate the user to the source control system via
    SSH.

### Amazon

Selecting this credential type enables synchronization of cloud
inventory with Amazon Web Services.

  - **Access Key**: User credentials that allow for programmatic calls
    to Amazon Web Services.

  - **Secret Key**: The secret key that corresponds to the user access
    key.

  - **STS Token**: Token generated by Amazon Web Services Security Token
    Service.

        `https://your.rhv.com/ovirt_engine/api`

      - See [Ansible Roles](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.1/html/administration_guide/chap-automating_rhv_configuration_using_ansible#Ansible_Roles)
        for more information on Ansible Roles available for Red Hat
        Virtualization.

### VMware

Selecting this credential type enables synchronization of inventory with
VMware vCenter.

**Important:**

If both {{ site.data.product.title_short }} and a VMware provider are located in the same IPv6-only network, use a DNS-resolvable hostname for the VMware provider in the **vCenter Host** field when adding credentials.

VMware credentials have several attributes that may be configured:

  - **Username**: The username to use to connect to vCenter.

  - **Password**: The password to use to connect to vCenter.

  - **vCenter Host**: The vCenter hostname or IP address to connect to.

**Note:**

If the VMware guest tools are not running on the instance, VMware inventory sync may not return an IP address for that instance.
