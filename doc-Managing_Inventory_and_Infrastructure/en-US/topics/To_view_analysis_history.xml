		Each time a SmartState Analysis is performed on a virtual machine, a record is created of the task. This information is accessed either from the <guilabel>Virtual Machine Accordion</guilabel> or the <guilabel>Virtual Machine Summary</guilabel>. Use this detail to find when the last analysis was completed and if it completed successfully. If the analysis resulted in an error, the error is shown here.
