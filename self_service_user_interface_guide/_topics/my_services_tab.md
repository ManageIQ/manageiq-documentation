## My Services Tab

The **My Services** tab lists all service requests individually with a summary of information associated with each service, including the **Service Name**, its current **Power State** represented by an icon, **Number of VMs**, **Owner**, date **Created**, and **Retires** date. Additionally, you can see the chargeback cost per service for a virtual machine’s month-to-date usage. You can filter or sort services by those entities, and by **Relative Cost**.

On the same screen, you have the option to edit the service name and description, edit tags, set ownership, retire the service now or at a later date, or remove the service by clicking more options *(represented by three dots)* next to the service. You also have options to perform power operations, that is start, stop, or suspend, at the service level. You can choose to click on a service where you can perform all of these actions at the service level using the designated buttons located at the top of the screen, as well as access the virtual machine dashboard, manage snapshots, and open the virtual machine and web console from under the **Resources** section. You can also control power operations and life cycle of virtual machine resources via more options
*(represented by three dots)*.

**Virtual Machine Dashboard:.**

From the **My Services** screen, click on a service and then on the virtual machine name or **View Details** under more options *(represented by three dots)* to access the virtual machine dashboard.
The dashboard displays the following information about the virtual machine resource:

  - Compliance

  - Retirement

  - Snapshots

  - Timeline of power events

  - Utilization of CPU, Memory, and Storage

  - Smart State analysis

  - Tags

  - Custom attributes

  - Disk usage

Additionally, you can also control the virtual machine power operations, and manage snapshots from the dashboard. A snapshot is a copy of the virtual machine’s disk file (VMDK) that captures the entire state of the
virtual machine at a point in time.

### Web Console (Cockpit) Integration

The Web console (Cockpit) is an interactive Linux server administrative interface. You can perform simple administration tasks such as starting
containers, storage administration, network configuration, and inspecting logs. While Cockpit allows you to monitor and administer several servers at the same time, your browser connects to a primary server that runs the Cockpit web service through which connections to
additional servers can be established.

The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} full administrative user interface and the Self Service user interface have enabled for users to access the Web console
(Cockpit interface) for a given virtual machine.

#### Accessing the Web Console

**Note:**

Launching of Cockpit requires as IP address for the virtual machine. It must be pre-configured and running on the virtual machine.

You can open the Web console (Cockpit) for a virtual machine from the ![Access Button](../images/ssui-access-button.png) button.

1. From the **My Services** screen, click on the service associated with the virtual machine you want to open the Web console for.

2. In **Resources**, click **Access** next to the virtual machine and select **Web Console**. A notification will appear to show the Cockpit interface is loading.
