Red Hat Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) 1.2 enables you to migrate virtual machines from VMware{nbsp}5.5 (and later) to  Red Hat Virtualization or Red Hat OpenStack Platform, using Red Hat CloudForms:

Red Hat Virtualization 4.3::
Red Hat Virtualization provides a virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You can manage your virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.3/[Red Hat Virtualization 4.3] documentation for more information.
+
See xref:Migrating_from_vmware_to_rhv[].

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 and 14::
Red Hat OpenStack Platform provides a scaleable, fault-tolerant, private or public cloud based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14[Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14[Red Hat OpenStack Platform 14] documentation for more information.
+
See xref:Migrating_from_vmware_to_osp[].

Red Hat CloudForms 4.7.6 or later::
Red Hat CloudForms is the environment in which you perform the migration. Red Hat CloudForms is a unified set of management tools for use across virtualized, private cloud, and public cloud platforms. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/[Red Hat CloudForms 4.7] documentation for more information.

// [NOTE]
// ====
// You can migrate a single virtual machine to Red Hat Container-native Virtualization (technical preview). See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.1/html/container-native_virtualization_users_guide/index#cnv-importing-vm-wizard-web[Importing a virtual machine] in the _Red Hat Container-native Virtualization User's Guide_.

= Migrating from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization

The migration process involves the following tasks:

. Planning the migration. See xref:Planning_the_migration_{context}[].
. Preparing the VMware, Red Hat Virtualization, and CloudForms environments. See xref:Preparing_the_environment_for_migration_to_{context}[].
. Migrating the virtual machines. See xref:Migrating_the_virtual_machines_{context}[].
. Troubleshooting, if necessary. See xref:Troubleshooting_{context}[].

== Preparing the environment for migration

Preparing your environment for migration involves the following tasks:

. Preparing the VMware environment. See xref:Preparing_the_vmware_environment_for_{context}[].
. Preparing the target environment. See xref:Preparing_the_1_2_{context}_environment[].
. Configuring the conversion hosts. See xref:Configuring_the_1_2_{context}_conversion_hosts_for_vddk[].

include::modules/ref_Vddk_note.adoc[]

[id="Preparing_the_vmware_environment_for_{context}"]
=== Preparing the VMware environment

Preparing the VMware environment for migration involves the following tasks:

. Extending the VMware network. See xref:Preparing_the_vmware_network_{context}[].
. Preparing the VMware virtual machines. See xref:Preparing_the_vmware_virtual_machines_for_{context}[].
. (Optional) Configuring a VMware hypervisor for more than ten concurrent migrations from that hypervisor. See xref:Configuring_vmware_hypervisor_for_more_than_10_concurrent_vddk_migrations_{context}[].

include::modules/proc_Preparing_the_vmware_network_1_2.adoc[leveloffset=+3]
include::modules/proc_Preparing_the_vmware_virtual_machines.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

If you are performing more than ten concurrent migrations from a VMware hypervisor, you must configure the hypervisor to support the additional connections. See xref:Configuring_vmware_hypervisor_for_more_than_10_concurrent_vddk_migrations_{context}[].

[id="Troubleshooting_{context}"]
== Troubleshooting

To identify errors, you can review the migration logs. See xref:Migration_logs_{context}[].

You can check these common issues and mistakes:

* Infrastructure mapping errors. See xref:Infrastructure_mapping_errors_{context}[].
* Migration plan errors. See xref:Migration_plan_errors_{context}[].
* IP address errors. See xref:IP_address_errors_{context}[].
* Environment configuration errors. See xref:Environment_configuration_errors_{context}[].

xref:Known_issues_{context}[] provides information about issues that will be addressed in a future release.
