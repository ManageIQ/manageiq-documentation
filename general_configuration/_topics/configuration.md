## Configuration

{% include configuration-gui.md %}

### Settings

The options under the **Settings** area provide a hierarchical view of options that allow you to configure global options for the infrastructure of your {{ site.data.product.title_short }} environment. At the top level, you have **Settings** including users, LDAP Groups, account roles, capacity and utilization collection, tag categories, values, and imports, custom variable imports, and license uploads. When you click on
**Settings** and expand it, you can configure **Analysis Profiles**, **Zones**, and **Schedules**.

![2041](../images/2041.png)

When you go the **Settings** accordion, you are automatically taken to the server list under **Zones**.

#### Regions

Use **Regions** for centralizing data which is collected from public and private virtualization environments. A region is ultimately represented as a single database for the VMDB. Regions are particularly useful when
multiple geographical locations need to be managed as they enable all the data collection to happen at each particular location and avoid data collection traffic across slow links between networks.

When multiple regions are being used, each with their own unique ID, a master region can be created to centralize the data of all the children regions into a single master database. To do this, configure each child
region to replicate its data to the master region database (Red Hat recommends use of region 99). This parent and child region is a one-to-many relationship.

Regions can contain multiple zones, which in turn contain appliances.
Zones are used for further segregating network traffic along with enabling failover configurations. Each appliance has the capability to be configured for a number of specialized server roles. These roles are
limited to the zone containing the appliance they run on.

Only one failover type of each server role can run in a zone. If multiple appliances have the same failover role, the extras are used as backups that activate only if the primary appliance fails. Non-failover server roles can run on multiple appliances simultaneously in a zone, so resources can be adjusted according to the workload those roles are responsible for.

The following diagram demonstrates an example of the multiple regions working together in a {{ site.data.product.title_short }} environment.

![7151](../images/7151.png)

The Master appliance is located in Chicago and contains a master region and a subregion that manages the worker appliances. The Mahwah technology center contains a single subregion that manages two zones.
Likewise the San Diego technology center contains a single subregion managing a single zone.

**Note:**

  - Replicating a parent region to a higher-level parent is not supported.

  - Parent regions can be configured after the child regions are online.

The following diagram provides a closer look at a region:
![7150](../images/7150.png)

In this region, we have several {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliances acting as UI nodes and worker nodes. These worker nodes execute tasks on the providers in your environment. The Region also uses a region database that reports to a master database on the main {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance.
All appliances can connect to the authentication services (Active Directory, LDAP, Identity Management), outgoing mail (SMTP), and network services (SNMP).

##### Region Scope

Regions are used to consolidate data from multiple VMDBs to a central database. The database at the top level, the master VMDB, cannot be used for operational tasks such as SmartState Analysis or Capacity and Utilization data collection. It is intended for use as a reporting
database that includes all information across multiple subordinate regions. The subordinate regions replicate their information to the master.

**Note:**

The subordinate regions are not aware of each other from a database perspective. You cannot see information from one subordinate region in another. The only VMDB with data visibility to all subordinate regions is the top level.

**Master Regions Scope**

  - Reports all information from all subordinate VMDBs reporting up to it.

  - Can perform power operations on virtual machines from subordinate regions.

  - Controls its own access control list.

**Subordinate Regions Scope**

  - Each subordinate controls its own access control independent of the other regions.

  - Can only do work (such as SmartState Analysis and Capacity and Utilization collection) in its own region.

  - Has no knowledge of the other regions.

  - Replicates its data up to the master region.

##### Region Settings

In the **Region** area, set items that apply to your entire {{ site.data.product.title_short }} infrastructure such as users, LDAP Groups, capacity and
utilization collection, company tags and tag categories, and licensing.
Regions are also used for database replication.

##### Capacity and Utilization Collection

###### Capacity and Utilization Collection Settings

Use **C & U Collection Settings** to select specifically which clusters and datastores you want to collect usage data for. By selecting a cluster, you are choosing to collect data for all hosts and virtual machines that are part of that cluster. You must also have a server with
the Capacity & Utilization **Coordinator**, **Data Collector**, and **Data Processor** roles enabled as well. See Section **Server Control Settings**.

After a provider has been discovered and its relationships refreshed, view the clusters, hosts, and datastores from the settings menu.
Navigate to **Settings**, then click on **Application Settings**. Click the menu: **Settings** > **Region**, then select the **C & U Collection** tab.

###### Enabling a Cluster, Host, or Datastore for Capacity and
Utilization Collection

To enable a cluster, host, or datastore for Capacity and Utilization Collection:

1.  Click **Settings**, then click on **Application Settings**. 

2.  Click the **Settings** accordion, then select **Region**, then click on the **C & U Collection** tab.

3.  In the **Clusters** area, check all clusters and hosts that you want
    to collect data for.

4.  In the **Datastores** area, check all datastores that you want to
    collect data for.

5.  Click **Save**.

**Note:**

1.  As new clusters, hosts, and datastores are discovered, you will need
    to come back to this configuration to enable collection of capacity
    and utilization data unless you have used the **Collect for All**
    check boxes.

2.  **Collect for All Clusters** must be checked to be able to collect
    capacity and utilization data from cloud providers such as Red Hat
    OpenStack Platform or Amazon EC2.

##### Tags

###### Company Tag Categories and Tags

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} allows you to create your own set of tags and tag
categories. Use tags to create a customized, searchable index for your resources. Depending on your database type, your tags may be case sensitive. After creating these values, you can apply them to your resources. There are two kinds of tags.

  - **Company tags** which you will see under **My Company Tags** for a resource. Create company tags from the settings menu. Browse to **Settings** > **Application Settings**. Click the **Settings** accordion, then select the **Region** and click on the **Tags** tab, then **My Company Tags**. A selection of company tags is provided to you by default as
    samples. These can be deleted if you do not need them, but are not
    recreated by {{ site.data.product.title_short }}.

  - **System tags** are assigned automatically by {{ site.data.product.title_short }}.

###### Creating a Tag Category

To create a tag category:

1.  Browse to **Settings > Application Settings**.

2.  Click on the **Settings** accordion, then **Region**.

3.  Select the **Tags** tab, then click on
    the **My Company Categories** tab.

4.  Click **Add** under the **Actions** column to create a new category.

5.  In the **Category Information** area: ![2042](../images/2042.png)

      - Use **Name** to create a short name that refers to category in
        the VMDB.

        **Note:**

        The **Name** and **Single Value** fields cannot be changed after
        the category has been added.

      - Use **Description** to type a brief explanation of how the
        category should be used. This shows when you try to add a value
        to the category.

      - Use **Long Description** to type a detailed explanation of the
        category.

      - Set **Show in Console** to `ON` when the category is ready for
        use in the console. For example, you want to populate values for
        the category before exposing it to users.

      - Set **Single Value** to `ON` for categories that can only have a
        single value assigned to a resource. For example, a virtual
        machine can only be assigned to one location, but could belong
        to more than one department. This cannot be changed after the
        category is created.

      - Set **Capture C & U Data by Tag** to `ON` for the ability to
        group capacity and utilization data by this tag category. To use
        this, be sure to assign this tag to all the resources that you
        want to group by.

6.  Click **Add**.

Repeat these steps for each category you need. After you have created the category, you can add values to it.

**Important**

If no values are created for a category, you are unable to assign a value from that category nor be able to filter by that category.

#### Zones

You can organize your {{ site.data.product.title_short }} Infrastructure into zones to configure failover and isolate traffic. A provider that is discovered by a server in a specific zone gets monitored and managed in that zone. All jobs, such as a SmartState Analysis or VM power operation, dispatched by a server in a specific zone can get processed by any {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance assigned to that same zone.

Zones can be created based on your own environment. You can make zones based on geographic location, network location, or function. When first started, a new server is put into the default zone.

Suppose you have four {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliances with two in the East
zone, appliances A and B, and two in the West zone, appliances C and D.
VC East is discovered by one of the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliances in the
{{ site.data.product.title_short }} Eastern zone. If Appliance A dispatches a job of
analyzing twenty virtual machines, this job can be processed by either
Appliance A or B, but not C or D.

**Note:**

Only users assigned the super administrator role can create zones. There must always be at least one zone. The **Default Zone** is provided and cannot be deleted.

##### Creating a Zone

7.  Click **Save**.

###### Basic Information Settings ![2059](../images/2059.png)

  - Use **Company Name** (maximum 20 characters) to customize the
    interface with your company’s name. You will see the company name
    when you are viewing or modifying the tags of an infrastructure
    object or virtual machine.

  - Specify the **Appliance Name** (maximum 20 characters) you want
    displayed as the appliance that you are logged into. You will see
    this in the upper right corner of the interface with the name of the
    consoles logged on user.

  - Use **Zone** to isolate traffic and provide load balancing
    capabilities. Specify the zone that you want this {{ site.data.product.title_short }}
    appliance to be a member of. At startup, the zone is set to default.

  - Use **Appliance Time Zone** to set the time zone for this server.

    **Note:**

    This is the time zone used when created scheduled analyses. This is
    not the same as the **Time Zone** parameter, which is found by
    navigating to the settings menu, then **My Settings**, then
    exploring the **Display Settings** area, and is the time zone
    displayed in the console.

  - Use **Default Locale** to specify the default language for this server.

###### Server Control Settings

A server role defines what a server can do. Red Hat recommends that
Database Operations, Event Monitor, Reporting, Scheduler, SmartState
Analysis, User Interface, Provider Inventory, Provider Operations, and
Web Services be enabled on at least one server in each zone. These roles
are enabled by default on all servers.

  - Use **Default Repository SmartProxy** to set the SmartProxy from
    which you refresh your virtual machine repositories. This host must
    have access to your repositories to analyze its virtual machines.

**Note:**

  - Only super administrators can change server roles.

  - If you are using more than one {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance, be sure to
    set this on all of the appliances.

###### Server Roles

**Note:**

  - Server roles that are in an active/active high availability
    configuration *(load balancing and failover protection)* are active
    in more than one location; whereas, roles that are in an
    active/passive *(primary/secondary in the case of
    {{ site.data.product.title_short }})* high availability configuration *(failover
    protection)*, if more than one {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server in a
    specific zone or region has this role, only one will be active
    *(primary)* at a time and a failover has to occur to the passive
    *(secondary)* appliance with that role.

| Capacity and Utilization Coordinator  | The Capacity & Utilization Coordinator role checks to see if it is time to collect data, somewhat like a scheduler. If it is time, a job is queued for the Capacity and Utilization Data Collector. The coordinator role is required to complete Capacity and Utilization data collection. If more than one {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server in a specific zone has this role, only one will be active at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Zone                 | Primary/Secondary                  |
| Capacity & Utilization Data Collector | The Capacity & Utilization Data Collector performs the actual collection of capacity and utilization data. This role has a dedicated worker, and there can be more than one {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server with this role in a zone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Zone                 | Active/Active                      |
| Capacity & Utilization Data Processor | The Capacity & Utilization Data Processor processes all of the data collected, allowing {{ site.data.product.title_short }} to create charts. This role has a dedicated worker, and there can be more than one {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server with this role in a zone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Zone                 | Active/Active                      |
| Database Operations                   | Use Database Operations to enable this {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server to run database backups or garbage collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Zone                 | Active/Active                      |
| Embedded Ansible                      | This role is disabled by default. The Embedded Ansible role supports Ansible Automation Inside functionality. Enable this role to configure playbook repositories and run playbooks natively to back service catalog items. **NOTE**: Enable the Provider Inventory server role in the same zone as the Embedded Ansible server role to ensure proper functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Region               | Primary/Secondary                  |
| Event Monitor                         | This role is enabled by default and provides the information shown in timelines. The Event Monitor is responsible for the work between the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server and your providers. It starts 2 workers for each provider. One worker, the monitor, is responsible for maintaining a connection to a provider, catching events, and putting them on the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} message queue for processing. The second worker, the handler, is a message queue worker responsible for delivering only those messages for a provider. You should have at least one of these in each zone.                                                   | Zone                 | Primary/Secondary                  |
| Git Repository                        | The Git Repositories Owner server role supports importing domains into automate from a git repository. This feature is available from the Automate \> Import/Export screen in the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} user interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Region               | Primary/Secondary                  |
| Notifier                              | Use this role if you will be using {{ site.data.product.title_short }} Control or Automate to forward SNMP traps to a monitoring system or send e-mails. See [Creating an Alert](#_to_create_an_alert) for details on creating SNMP alerts. If more than one {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server in a specific region has this role, only one will be active at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Region               | Primary/Secondary                  |
| Provider Inventory                    | This role is enabled by default. This role is responsible for refreshing provider information including EMS, hosts, virtual machines, and clusters, and is also responsible for capturing datastore file lists. If more than one {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server in a specific zone has this role, only one will be active at a time. Required in the same zone as a {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance with the Embedded Ansible role enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Zone                 | Primary/Secondary                  |
| Provider Operations                   | This role is enabled by default. This role sends stop, start, suspend, shutdown guest, clone, reconfigure, and unregister to the provider, directly from the console or through a policy action if you have {{ site.data.product.title_short }} Control. More than one {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server can have this role in a zone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Zone                 | Active/Active                      |
| RHN Mirror                            | An appliance with RHN Mirror enabled acts as a server containing a repository with the latest {{ site.data.product.title_short }} packages. This also configures other appliances within the same region to point to the chosen RHN Mirror server for updates. This provides a low bandwidth method to update environments with multiple appliances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | N/A                  | Active/Active                      |
| Reporting                             | This role is enabled by default. The Reporting role specifies which {{ site.data.product.title_short }} servers can generate reports. If you do not have a {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server set to this role in a zone, then no reports can be generated in that zone. You should have at least one of these in each zone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Zone                 | Active/Active                      |
| Scheduler                             | This role is enabled by default. The Scheduler sends messages to start all scheduled activities such as report generation and SmartState analysis. This role also controls all system schedules such as capacity and utilization data gathering. One server in each region must be assigned this role or scheduled {{ site.data.product.title_short }} events will not occur. If more than one {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server in a specific region has this role, only one will be active at a time.                                                                                                                                                               | Region               | Primary/Secondary                  |
| SmartProxy                            | Enabling the SmartProxy role turns on the embedded SmartProxy on the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server. The embedded SmartProxy can analyze virtual machines that are registered to a host and templates that are associated with a provider. To provide visibility to repositories, install the SmartProxy on a host from the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} console. This SmartProxy can also analyze virtual machines on the host on which it is installed. Enabling the SmartProxy role on an appliance requires selecting the SmartProxy Affinity for a zone to run a SmartState Analysis. By default, no selections are enabled under SmartProxy Affinity. | Zone                 | Active/Active                      |
| SmartState Analysis                   | This role is enabled by default. The SmartState Analysis role controls which {{ site.data.product.title_short }} servers can control SmartState Analyses and process the data from the analysis. You should have at least one of these in each zone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Zone                 | Active/Active                      |
| User Interface                        | This role is enabled by default. The Web Services role must also be enabled with this role to log into the user interface, as the User Interface role queries the API to receive tokens for login. Uncheck User Interface if you do not want users to be able to access this {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server using the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} console. For example, you may want to turn this off if the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server is strictly being used for capacity and utilization or reporting generation.

###### VMware Console Settings

If you are using the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} control feature set, then you have
the ability to connect to a Web console for virtual machines that are
registered to a host. To use this feature, you must have VNC installed,
[VMware’s WebMKS SDK enabled in {{ site.data.product.title_short }}](../managing_infrastructure_and_inventory/index.html#configuring-webmks-support-in-manageiq),
or the VMRC native desktop application installed for your environment.

**Note:**

See vendor documentation to ensure you are installing appropriate
applications for your virtual infrastructure. Once you have installed
the required software, you must specify its version in the
{{ site.data.product.title_short }} configuration settings.

![2061](../images/2061.png)

  - If you select **VNC**, type in the port number used. This port must
    be open on the target virtual machine and the VNC software must be
    installed there. On the computer that you are running the console
    from, you must install the appropriate version of Java Runtime if it
    is not already installed.

  - If you select **VMware WebMKS**, select the appropriate version.

  - If using **VMware VMRC** desktop application, be sure that you have
    fulfilled the requirements for your vCenter version. The correct
    version of the VMRC desktop application from VMware must be
    installed on the client computer. To do this, log into the vCenter
    Web Service and attempt to open a virtual machine console. The
    vSphere Web Client must be installed on vCenter version 5, and the
    provider must be registered to it. For vCenter version 4, the VMware
    vCenter Management Webservices must be running.

###### Configuring SNMP

You can use Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traps to send
alerts for various aspects of a {{ site.data.product.title_short }} environment.

**Requirements**

  - Configure your SNMP management station to accept traps from
    {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliances. Consult your management station’s
    documentation.

  - Each appliance that could process SNMP traps must have the `snmpd`
    and `snmptrapd` daemons running.

| scan\_via\_host       | If you change scan\_via\_host to false, {{ site.data.product.title_short }} will use the Management System to scan which is limited by the concurrent\_per\_ems setting instead of the concurrent\_per\_host setting. Note this will greatly increase traffic to the Management System. Default: true |

Table: ems\_refresh

| Parameters                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| capture\_vm\_created\_on\_date                      | Set to false to turn off historical event retrieval. Set to true to turn on. By setting the flag to true {{ site.data.product.title_short }} will try to set the "ems\_created\_on" column in the vms table after an ems refresh for new VMs and any VMs with a nil "ems\_created\_on" value. {{ site.data.product.title_short }} looks at event information in our database as well as looking up historical event data from the management system. This is optional since the historical lookup could timeout. Default: false |
| collect\_advanced\_settings                         | Set to false if you do not want to collect advanced Virtual Machine settings during a management system refresh. This will increase the speed of the refresh, but less data will be collected. If the parameter is not listed, then the value is true. Default: true                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| get\_private\_images                                | For EC2 refreshes only; whether or not to retrieve private images. Default: true                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| get\_public\_images                                 | For EC2 refreshes only; whether or not to retrieve public images. Default: false. Warning: setting get\_public\_images to true loads several thousand images in the VMDB by default and may cause performance issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| full\_refresh\_threshold                            | The number of targeted refreshes requested before they are rolled into a full refresh. For example, if the system and/or the user target a refresh against 7 VMs and 2 Hosts (9 targets), when the refresh actually occurs it will do a partial refresh against those 9 targets only. However, if a 10th had been added, the system would perform a full EMS refresh instead. Default: 100                                                                                              |
| raise\_vm\_snapshot\_complete\_if\_created\_within: | Raises vm\_snapshot\_complete event for a snapshot being added to VMDB only if the create time in Virtual Center is within the configured period of time.

#### Schedules

##### Scheduling SmartState Analyses

From the **Schedules** area in **Settings**, you can schedule the
analyses of virtual machines, hosts, clusters, and datastores to keep
the information current. Depending on which resource you want to
analyze, you can filter which ones to analyze. You may also specify only
one virtual machine or perform an analysis on all virtual machines. In
addition, you can schedule compliance checks, and database backups.

###### Scheduling a SmartState Analysis or Compliance Check

To schedule a SmartState Analysis or Compliance Check:

1.  Browse to **Settings** > **Application Settings**.

2.  Click on the **Settings** accordion, then click **Schedules**.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png)(**Configuration**), and ![plus
    green](../images/plus_green.png)(**Add a new Schedule**).

4.  In the **Basic Information** area, type in a **Name** and
    **Description** for the schedule.

5.  Select **Active** to enable this scan.

6.  From the **Action** list, select the type of analysis to schedule.
    Based on the type of analysis you choose, you are presented with one
    of the following group boxes: ![2079](../images/2079.png)

      - **VM Analysis**: Displays **VM Selection** where you can choose
        to analyze **All VMs**, **All VMs for Provider**, **All VMs for
        Cluster**, **All VMs for Host**, **A single VM**, or **Global
        Filters**.

      - **Template Analysis**: Displays **Template Selection** where you
        can choose to analyze **All Templates**, **All Templates for
        Provider**, **All Templates for Cluster**, **All Templates for
        Host**, **A single Template**, or **Global Filters**.

      - **Host Analysis**: Displays **Host Selection** where you can
        choose to analyze **All Hosts**, **All Hosts for Provider**, **A
        single Host**, or **Global Filters**.

        **Note:**

        You can only schedule host analyses for connected virtual
        machines, not repository virtual machines that were discovered
        through that host. Since repository virtual machines do not
        retain a relationship with the host that discovered them, there
        is no current way to scan them through the scheduling feature.
        The host is shown because it may have connected virtual machines
        in the future when the schedule is set to run.

      - **Cluster / Deployment Role Analysis**: Displays **Cluster Selection** where you can choose to analyze **All Clusters**,
        **All Clusters for Provider**, or **A single Cluster**.

      - **Datastore Analysis**: Displays **Datastore Selection** where
        you can choose to analyze **All Datastores**, **All Datastores for Host**, **All Datastores for Provider**, **A single Datastore**, or **Global Filters**.

      - **VM Compliance Check**: Displays **VM Selection** where you can
        choose to analyze **All VMs**, **All VMs for Provider**, **All VMs for Cluster**, **All VMs for Host**, **A single VM**, or
        **Global Filters**.

      - **Host Compliance Check**: Displays **Host Selection** where you
        can choose to analyze **All Hosts**, **All Hosts for Provider**,
        **All Hosts for Cluster**, **A single Host**, or **Global Filters**.

      - **Database Backup**: Under **Type**, displays **Network File System**, **Samba**, **Amazon AWS S3** and **OpenStack Swift**..

7.  By applying **Global Filters** within any of the above items, you
    can designate which virtual machines or hosts to analyze.

8.  In **Run**, set the frequency of the analysis to run. There are
    further options based on which **Run** option you choose.

      - Click **Once** to have the analysis run only one time.

      - Click **Daily** to run the analysis on a daily basis. You will
        be prompted to select the number of days between each analysis.

      - Click **Hourly** to run the analysis hourly. You will be
        prompted to select the number of hours between each analysis.

9.  Select a **Time Zone**.

    **Note:**

    If you change the **Time Zone**, you will need to reset the stating
    date and time.

10. Type or select a date to begin the schedule in **Starting Date**.

11. Select a **Starting Time** based on a 24 hour clock in the selected
    Time Zone.

12. Click **Add**.

###### Modifying a Schedule

6.  Click **Add**.

#### Managing Tenant and Project Quotas

Use the following procedure to allocate or edit quotas for tenants and
projects.

**Note:**

Quota is allocated based on the user’s current group. If the user
belongs to multiple groups, you must change to the desired group before
allocating or editing group quota. See [Groups](#groups) for more
details.

1.  Browse to **Settings** > **Application Settings**.

2.  Click on the **Access Control** accordion, then click **Tenants**.

3.  Click on the **Tenant** or **Project** where you want to add a
    quota, click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and

    and **Email Address** for the user. An email address is required;
    omitting the user email address can result in unsuccessful
    provisioning requests.

    ![available groups](../images/available_groups.png)

    <div class="important">

      - If you are using LDAP, but did not enable **Get User Groups from
        LDAP** in your server’s **Authentication** tab, you will need to
        define a user. The UserID must match exactly the user’s name as
        defined in your directory service. Use all lowercase characters
        to ensure the user can be found in the VMDB.

      - When the user logs in, they use their LDAP password.

    </div>

5.  Select one or more groups from **Available Groups**.

6.  Click **Add**.

#### Deleting a User

For security reasons, delete any user that no longer needs access to the
information or functions of the server.

To delete a user:

1.  Browse to **Settings** > **Application Settings**.

2.  Click on the **Access Control** accordion, then click **Users**.

3.  Select the user you want to delete.

4.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and ![gui
    delete](../images/gui_delete.png) (**Delete selected Users**) to
    delete a user.

#### Groups

User groups create filters and assign roles to users. You can either
create your own groups, or leverage your LDAP directory service to
assign groups of users to account roles. For a list of what each
pre-defined account role can do, see [Roles](#roles).

A user can exist in multiple groups. However, a group can only be
assigned one account role.

If you belong to multiple groups, you can change the current group.
The Current Group affects quota and other settings for the user,
including permissions for controlling the tasks that you can complete and the data that you can view.
To change the group, click the group name in the upper left of the screen,
and select your preferred group from the listed groups.

![change group](../images/change_group.png)

#### Creating a Group

To create a user group:

1.  Browse to **Settings** > **Application Settings**.

2.  Click on the **Access Control** accordion, then click **Groups**.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), and ![plus
    green](../images/plus_green.png) (**Add a new Group**) to create a
    group.

4.  Enter a name for the group in the **Name** field. To ensure
    compatibility with tags, use underscores in place of spaces. For
    example, {{ site.data.product.title_short }}-`test_group`.

5.  Select a **Role** to map to this group. For a description of each
    {{ site.data.product.title_short }} role, see [Account Roles and
    Descriptions](#account-roles-and-descriptions).

6.  Select the **Project/Tenant** this group must belong to.

7.  Limit what users in this group can view by selecting filters in the
    **Assign Filters** area.

    1.  Click the **\<My Company\> Tags** tab to select the tags that
        users in this group can access. Resources with the selected tags
        attached can be accessed by this group. Select tags using one of
        the options in the **This user is limited to** list:

          - Select **Specific Tags**, then check the boxes for the tags
            that you want to limit this user to. The items that have
            changed will show in blue italicized font.

          - Select **Tags Based On Expression**, then create tags based
            on an expression using AND, OR, or NOT. This allows you to
            further limit the resources accessible to a user: for
            example, to specify a combination of tags that must exist on
            a resource. ![tag expression
            editor](../images/tag_expression_editor.png)

    2.  Click the **Host & Clusters** tab.

        1.  Check the boxes for the host and clusters that you want to
            limit this user to. The items that have changed will show in
            blue italicized font. ![2088](../images/2088.png)

    3.  Click the **VMs & Templates** tab. This shows folders that you
        have created in your virtual infrastructure.

        1.  Check the boxes for the folders that you want to limit this
            user to. The items that have changed will show in blue
            italicized font.

8.  Click **Add**.

After creating a group, assign one or more users to the group by editing
a user.

#### Roles

When you create a group, you must specify a role to give the group
rights to resources in the console. The group’s role determines the
scope of access for the users that are members of the group.

![general config roles jcs](../images/general_config_roles_jcs.png)

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} provides a default group of roles, but you can also
create your own, or copy and edit the default groups.

**Note:**

If you have enabled **Get Role from LDAP** under **LDAP Settings**, then
the role is determined by the LDAP user’s group membership in the
directory service.

To view details of a role and its level of access:

1.  Browse to **Settings** > **Application Settings**.

2.  Click on the **Access Control** accordion, then click **Roles**.

3.  Click on a role from the list to display role information and the
    product features the role can access (marked by a checkmark). You
    can expand the categories under **Product Features** to see further
    detail.

The table below shows a summary of the functions available to each role.

2.  Click on the **Access Control** accordion, then click **Roles**.

3.  Click **Configuration**, and ![plus
    green](../images/plus_green.png) **Add a new Role**. Alternatively, you can copy an existing role to a new role by clicking **Copy the selected Role to a new Role**.

4.  In the **Role Information** area, type a name for the new role. For
    **Access Restriction for Catalog Items, Orchestration Stacks, Key Pairs, Services, VMs, and Templates**, select if
    you want to limit users with this role to only see resources owned
    by the user or their group, owned by the user, or all resources
    (**None**): ![role info](../images/role_info.png)

5.  Under **Product Features (Editing)**, navigate to the appropriate
    feature and enable or disable it: ![product features
    editing](../images/product_features_editing.png)

6.  Click **Add**.

### Diagnostics

Browse to **Settings** > **Application Settings**. Click on the **Diagnostics** tab to see the status of the different {{ site.data.product.title_short }} roles and workers for each server, view and collect logs, and gather data if there are any gaps in capacity and utilization information. The Diagnostics area is designed in a hierarchy.

  - At the **region** level, you can see replication status, backup the VMDB, and run garbage collection on the VMDB.

  - At the **zone** level, you can see {{ site.data.product.title_short }} roles by servers and servers by roles. In addition, you can set log collection values for a specific zone, and collect gap data for capacity and utilization.

  - At the **server** level, you can see the workers for each server, set log collection values for a specific server, and view current logs.

#### Region Diagnostics

Using the console, you can set the priority of server regional roles, review and reset replication, and create backups of your database either on demand or on a schedule.

Regions are used primarily to consolidate multiple VMDBs into one master VMDB for reporting while zones are used to define functional groups of servers. There can be only one region per VMDB, but multiple zones per region (or VMDB). Some server roles are aware of each other across {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliances at the region level. This means that redundancy and failover rules apply at the region level. You can also set priorities for the server roles that provide failover.

##### Server Role Priorities

If you have multiple servers in your environment with duplicate failover roles, then you can set the priority of the server role.

  - Only server roles that support failover can be marked as primary.
    These roles only allow one server to be active at a time. These are
    **Notifier**, **Capacity & Utilization Coordinator**, **Event Monitor**, **Scheduler**, **Storage Inventory**, and **Provider Inventory**.

  - All other server roles are additive. The more servers with that role in a zone the more work that can be performed.

There are three role priorities.

  - **Primary**: There can only be one primary per zone or region per
    role. When an appliance is started, the system looks to see if any
    role is set to primary. If that is the case, the role is activated
    on that appliance and deactivated from the secondary. In the
    console, primary roles are shown in bold letters. The text turns red
    if the server goes down. You must actively set the primary priority.

  - **Secondary**: This is the default priority. There can be multiple
    secondaries. When an appliance is started, if no primary is found in
    the zone, the first appliance to start takes the role. In the
    console, secondary roles are displayed normally with the word
    "secondary".

  - **Tertiary**: If all appliances with primary roles or secondary
    roles were down, one of the tertiary would be activated. The reason
    for tertiary is to ensure that if a server with crucial roles such
    as Provider Inventory or Event Monitor goes down, you have a way to
    associate those roles to different appliances by organizing the
    priorities. Tertiary roles simply show as active in the console.

#### Region Aware Server Roles

| Role                | More than one per Region | Can have Priority Set |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Automation Engine   | Y                        | N                     |

    delete](../images/gui_delete.png) (**Demote Server**) to demote the
    priority of this server for this role.

#### Zone Diagnostics

The console provides a way to see all the server roles that a server has
been assigned and if these roles are running. This is especially helpful
when you have multiple servers with different server roles. For each
zone you can also set a central place for all logs to be collected, and
collect capacity and utilization data that may be missing.

##### Viewing the Status of Server Roles

To view the status of server roles:

    {{ site.data.product.title_short }} console.

##### Capacity and Utilization Repair

Under certain circumstances, it is possible that {{ site.data.product.title_short }} is not
able to collect capacity and utilization data. This could be due to
password expiration, a change in rights to the cloud provider and this
change didn’t provide enough granularity to the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} service
account, or network connectivity. The gap data is collected directly by
extracting the monthly performance data. Gap collection need to be
completed for each zone individually. Therefore, the procedure below
need to be repeated for each zone.

###### Repairing Capacity and Utilization Data

To repair capacity and utilization data:

1.  Log in to a {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance located in the zone for which you want to gather the data.

2.  Browse to **Settings** > **Application Settings**.

3.  Click on the **Diagnostics** accordion, then click the **Zone** that you want to view.

4.  Click **C & U Gap Collection**.

    1.  Select the appropriate **Timezone**.

    data.

  - **C & U Metrics Processors**, which processes the collected capacity
    and utilization data.

  - **Event Handlers** put events from the Event Monitor into the VMDB
    and starts {{ site.data.product.title_short }} processes if needed base on that
    information.

  - **Event Monitors** that communicate with the external cloud provider
    to deliver up to date event information.

  - **Generic Workers** that perform long running and priority
    processes.

### Database Operations

#### Viewing Information on the VMDB

The **Database** accordion displays a summary of VMDB information, a
list of all tables and indexes, settings for the tables, active client
connection, and database utilization.

To view information on the VMDB:

1.  Browse to **Settings** > **Application Settings**.

2.  Click the **Database** accordion.

3.  Click **VMDB** in the tree view on the left.

4.  Click the appropriate tab to view the desired information:

      - **Summary**: displays statistics about the database.

      - **Tables**: displays a clickable list of all the tables.

      - **Indexes**: displays a clickable list of all the indexes.

      - **Settings**: displays a list of all tables, their descriptions,
        and other valuable Information.

      - **Client Connections**: displays all current connections to the
        VMDB.

      - **Utilization**: displays usage charges for the disk and index
        nodes.

#### Database Regions and Replication

Regions are used to create a central database for reporting and
charting. Do not use the database at the top level for operational tasks
such as SmartState analysis or capacity and utilization data collection.
Assign each server participating in the region a unique number during
the regionalization process, then set your subordinate regions to
replicate to the top region.

**Important**

All {{ site.data.product.title_short }} databases in a multi-region deployment must use the same security key.

##### Creating a Region

In principle, a region is created when you set up your {{ site.data.product.title_short }} environment on the first appliance for the region. However, you can also create a region on an appliance where a database has already been set up. This process involves dropping and rebuilding the existing database to accommodate the new region number, and takes several minutes to complete.

**Warning**

Performing this procedure destroys any existing data and cannot be
undone. Back up the existing database before proceeding. By default, new appliances are assigned region 0. Do not use this number when creating a region because duplicate region numbers can compromise the integrity of the data in the database.

1.  Log in to the appliance as the **root** user.

2.  Enter `appliance_console`, and press **Enter**.

3.  Press any key.

4.  Select `Stop EVM Server Processes`.

5.  Enter `Y` to confirm.

6.  Choose `Configure Application`.

7.  Enter a database region number that has not been used in your
    environment. Do not enter duplicate region numbers because this can
    corrupt the data.

8.  Enter `Y` to confirm.

9.  The menu reappears after all processes are complete.

10. Select `Start EVM Server Processes`.

11. Enter `Y` to confirm.

12. Select **Quit** to exit the advanced settings menu.

#### Configuring Database Replication and Centralized Administration

To configure database replication, you must configure one
{{ site.data.product.title_short }} instance to act as a global copy, and one or more other instances to act as remote copies. This database replication relationship can only be configured on {{ site.data.product.title_short }} instances that are of the same version. Configuring database replication in this version of {{ site.data.product.title_short }} automatically enables centralized
administration, eliminating the need for further configuration.
Centralized administration in {{ site.data.product.title_short }} supports life cycle management operations that can be initiated from the global copy and processed and executed on the remote copy.

**Important**

  - You must configure at least one remote copy before you can configure the global copy. Changes to the role of a {{ site.data.product.title_short }} instance take several minutes to take effect.

  - The region number must be unique on each {{ site.data.product.title_short }} instance where replication is configured. See [Creating a Region](#creating_a_region) for instructions on how to create a region.

  - Enabling the `EvmRole-user_global_region` role will only provide
    access to specific operations that can be performed on a global
    region.

##### Configuring a Remote Copy

Configure a {{ site.data.product.title_short }} instance to act as a remote copy from which data will be replicated to the global copy.

1.  Browse to **Settings** > **Application Settings**.

2.  Click the **Settings** accordion.

3.  Click the region where the instance is located.

4.  Click **Replication**.

5.  Select **Remote** from the **Type** list.

        subscription if required, or click the menu on the right in
        order to **Validate** or **Discard**.

7.  Click **Save**.

**Note:**

Once you configure a {{ site.data.product.title_short }} instance to act as a global copy,
and one or more other instances to act as remote copies: \* centralized
administration is automatically enabled after the initial data sync is
complete. \* you will see the type of region you are logging into
(global or remote) on the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} user interface login
screen.

Database replication and centralized administration are now enabled on
your instances. To open virtual machines of a remote region from the
global region and perform required operations:

#### Backing Up and Restoring {{ site.data.product.title_short }} in a Kubernetes Based Environment (podified)

**Prerequisites:**
   - Velero and Restic must be installed and working in your cluster. For more information on Velero, see the [Velero documentation](https://velero.io/docs/v1.5/). For more information on Restic, see the [Restic documentation](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 

**Note:** The operator adds labels and/or annotations to everything that needs to be backed up. You can easily and quickly backup only what is required. The operator will add annotations for restic volume backups for example, `backup.velero.io/backup-volumes: <volume-label>`.

1. The backup label key can be configured by adding the following to the CR. The default label is applied if no value is specified for `backupLabelName`.
   ```
   ...
   spec:
     ...
     backupLabelName: <your label name>
   ```
2. Create a backup by running the command:
   ```
   velero backup create <your backup name> --include-namespaces <your namespace> -l <your label name>=t
   ```
3. In order to restore a backup, first ensure the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} CRD exists. Then, restore the backup by running the commands:
   ```
   oc new-project <your namespace>
   velero restore create --from-backup <your backup name>
   ```

#### Backing Up and Restoring a Database for an Appliance Based Environment

##### Running a Single Database Backup 

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} supports database backups to **Network File System
(NFS)**, **Samba**, **Amazon Web Service(AWS) S3** and **OpenStack
Swift** storage.

**Note:**

Database backups to **AWS S3** require valid AWS credentials to perform
this operation.

To run a single database backup:

1.  Browse to **Settings** > **Application Settings**.

2.  Click the **Diagnostics** accordion and click the **Region** name.

3.  Click the **Database** tab.

        check the settings.

      - If you select **Network File System**, enter the **URI**.

6.  Click **Submit** to run the database backup.

##### Restoring a Database from a Backup

If a database is corrupt or fails, restore it from a backup. You can
restore a backup from a local file, NFS, or Samba.

To restore a database from a backup:

1.  Save the database backup file as `/tmp/evm_db.backup`.
    {{ site.data.product.title_short }} looks specifically for this file when restoring a
    database from a local backup.

2.  If you are restoring a database backup on a high availability
    environment, stop the replication manager service
    (`repmgr13.service`). This is not required in other
    {{ site.data.product.title_short }} configurations.

        # systemctl stop repmgr13.service

3.  Log in to the appliance as the **root** user.

4.  Enter `appliance_console`, and press **Enter**.

5.  Select `Stop EVM Server Processes` to stop processes on all servers
    that connect to this VMDB.

6.  Enter `Y` to confirm.

7.  After all processes are stopped, press **Enter** to return to the
    menu.

8.  Press **Enter** again to manually configure settings.

9.  Select `Restore Database From Backup`, then specify the location to
    restore the backup from in the `Restore Database File` menu:

    1.  If you saved the database backup file locally as
        `/tmp/evm_db.backup`, select `Local file`. You can also restore
        from a `Network File System (nfs)` or `Samba (smb)`.

    2.  Specify the location of the backup file.

        **Note:**

        The appliance console menu may respond slowly if connections are
        open and the server is still shutting down. If this occurs, wait
        a minute and try again.

10. Enter `Y` to keep the database backup after restoring from it. Enter `N` to delete it.

11. Press `Y` to confirm.

12. After the backup completes, press **Enter** to return to the menu.

13. Press **Enter** again to manually configure settings.

14. Select `Start EVM Server Processes` to restart all processes on
    servers that connect to this VMDB.

15. Enter `Y` to confirm.

16. If you are restoring a database backup on a high availability
    environment, start the replication manager service
    (`repmgr13.service`). This is not required in other
    {{ site.data.product.title_short }} configurations.

        # systemctl start repmgr13.service

#### Performing a Binary Backup and Restoring the Database

Preserve data at the file system level by performing a binary backup.
This includes all databases, users and roles, and other objects.

**Note:**

This procedure uses the `pg_basebackup` utility to perform a remote
database backup and create a full replacement of the PostgreSQL data
directory, capturing the exact state of the database when the backup
finishes. For more information on the `pg_basebackup` utility, see the
PostgreSQL documentation.

##### Performing a Binary Backup

Create a binary backup and store it as a `gzip` tar file inside the
{{ site.data.product.title_short }} backup directory.

<div class="important">

A PostgreSQL superuser or user with *Replication* permissions are
required to perform this procedure.

</div>

1.  SSH into the database server as the **root** user or provide
    PostgreSQL superuser credentials.

2.  Run the `pg_basebackup` command to create the backup:

        # pg_basebackup -X fetch -h hostname -U root -Ft -z -D filename

    **Note:**

    **-h** *hostname* specifies the IP address of the database server.

    **-D** *filename* specifies the name of the directory created to
    contain the backup.

##### Restoring a Database from the Binary Backup

Restore your PostgreSQL binary backup using the following steps. This
process will require stopping both EVM and PostgreSQL services before
restoring data.

1.  Copy the existing backup to the target VM:

        # scp filename/base.tar.gz root@hostname:/var/www/miq

2.  SSH to the target VM:

        # ssh root@hostname

3.  Stop both the EVM and PostgreSQL servers:

        # systemctl stop evmserverd
        # systemctl stop $APPLIANCE_PG_SERVICE

4.  Rename the existing data directory:

        # mv /var/lib/pgsql/data /var/lib/pgsql/data.backup

5.  Create a clean data directory:

        # mkdir /var/lib/pgsql/data

6.  Unzip the tar file to the new directory:

        # tar -xzf /var/www/miq/base.tar.gz -C /var/lib/pgsql/data

7.  Correct permissions:

        # chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/pgsql/data
        # chmod 700 /var/lib/pgsql/data

8.  Restart the PostgreSQL and EVM servers:

        # systemctl start $APPLIANCE_PG_SERVICE
        # systemctl start evmserverd

#### Running Database Garbage Collection

The database server collects garbage automatically, but Red Hat may
occasionally direct you to run database garbage collection manually in
order to reclaim unused space in your VMDB.

To run database garbage collection:

1.  Browse to **Settings** > **Application Settings**.

2.  Click the **Diagnostics** accordion and click the **Region** name.

3.  Click the **Database** tab.

4.  In the **Run Database Garbage Collection Now** box, click
    **Submit**.

#### Changing the Database Password

Use the following procedures to change the password on appliances
containing an internal database, and on worker appliances.

To change the password for an external database, use the procedure in
[Changing the Password on the Worker
Appliances](#changing-the-password-on-the-worker-appliances).

**Note:**

See [Appliance Types](../deployment_planning_guide/index.html#appliance-types)
in the *Deployment Planning Guide* for a summary of different types of
appliances.

##### Changing the Password on the Database Appliance

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} provides a default database password for the internal
PostgreSQL database.

To change the password, you need to stop the {{ site.data.product.title_short }}
service, change the password for the PostgreSQL database, run a command
to change the password in the configuration file that `evmserverd` uses
to access the server, and restart the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance.

1.  Stop the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} service:

    1.  SSH into the appliance.

    2.  To stop the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} service, run the following
        command:

            service evmserverd stop

2.  Use `pgadmin` to change the password for your {{ site.data.product.title_short }}
    database (default is `vmdb_production`). If you do not have
    `pgadmin`, you can change the password by running:

        psql -U root -d vmdb_production

    1.  At the vmdb\# prompt, type:

            ALTER USER root WITH PASSWORD 'newpassword';

    2.  To exit `psql`, type:

        ```
        \q
        ```

3.  Change the password in the configuration file that `evmserverd` uses
    to access the server:

        /var/www/miq/vmdb/tools/fix_auth.rb --databaseyml --password newpassword

4.  Restart the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} service:

        service evmserverd start

5.  Verify that you can log in to the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} console.

##### Changing the Password on the Worker Appliances

1.  Stop the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} service:

    1.  SSH into the appliance.

    2.  To stop the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} service, run the following
        command:

            service evmserverd stop

2.  Change the password in the configuration file that `evmserverd` uses
    to access the server:

        /var/www/miq/vmdb/tools/fix_auth.rb --databaseyml --password newpassword

3.  Restart the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} service:

        service evmserverd start

    <div class="important">

    In a high availability environment, if using the same PostgreSQL
    user for replication, you must also change the password in the
    `/var/lib/pgsql/.pgpass` file on every database node.

    Additionally, if the password for the user being used for
    region-to-region replication is changing, users must also change the
    password in the replication subscription screen. See [Configuring
    the Global Copy](#configuring-the-global-copy).

    </div>

#### Adding a New Appliance to an Existing Region with a Non-default Password

1.  Create the new appliance.

2.  Start the appliance, but do not go into any of the configuration
    options, instead **SSH** into the new appliance.

3.  In the **/var/www/miq/vmdb** directory, create a file called
    `REGION`. Its only contents should be the number of the Region that
    it is joining. (You could also just copy the `REGION` file from the
    VMDB appliance.)

4.  Edit the **database.yml** file in the **/var/www/miq/vmdb**
    directory. (You may want to save from the original.)

    1.  Replace the contents of the **"production"** section with the
        contents of the **"base"** section.

    2.  Edit the **"host"** parameter to match the IP of the appliance
        hosting the VMDB.

    3.  Save the new **database.yml**.

5.  Run the following command to change the password in the
    configuration file that `evmserverd` uses to access the server:

        /var/www/miq/vmdb/tools/fix_auth.rb --databaseyml --password newpassword

6.  Restart the new worker appliance:

        service evmserverd restart
