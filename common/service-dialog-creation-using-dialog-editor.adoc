{product-title} includes a drag-and-drop service dialog editor to create service dialogs. The editor, with its drag-and-drop feature, provides a visual representation of the components that comprise a service dialog. Easily design your service dialog utilizing dialog tabs, sections (previously referred to as boxes), and elements.

When users access a service, the majority of options available to them are preset and cannot be altered. The requirements for the service determine the options and fields that need to be present in the dialog for user input.  A service dialog exposes some of those options to the user so that even if they are ordering a basic Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 machine, for example, they can at least choose the amount of memory, virtual CPUs, or other options available to the instance they order. In cases where certain fields must be unique, such as the name of virtual machines in Red Hat Virtualization, users must enter their own unique name for the virtual machine they choose or the operation will fail, so this field must be exposed. See Appendix A. at the end of this document for an example about creating a service for provisioning a virtual machine through Red Hat Virtualization that utilizes a service dialog. 

A service dialog contains three components:

* One or more *Tabs*.
* Inside the tabs, one or more *Sections*. Note that in the previous method of creating service dialogs using the {product-title_short} user interface, *Sections* were referred to as *Boxes*.
* Inside the sections, one or more *Elements*. Elements are controls that accept input. Elements contain methods, like check boxes, drop-down lists or text fields, to fill in the options on the provisioning dialog.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The names of the elements must correspond to the options used in the provisioning dialog.
