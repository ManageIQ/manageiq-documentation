# Adding or Viewing Network Providers

**Note:**

All supported network providers — OpenStack Network, Azure Network, and
Amazon EC2 Network, are added or removed automatically upon adding or
removing the respective cloud provider.

Viewing network providers:

1.  Browse to menu: **Networks > Providers** to see a list of all network
    providers, along with information such as *Name*, *Type*, *EVM
    Zone*, *Number of Instances*, *Subnets*, and *Region*.

2.  Click on a provider from the list to view its summary screen.

Network providers summary:

The summary screen includes tables containing information on
*Properties*, *Status*, *Relationships*, *Overview*, and *Smart
Management*. Click on rows in the *Relationship* and *Overview* tables
to see detailed information for individual entities.

Accordion tabs in the sidebar provide access to **Properties** and
**Relationships** details.

Click on **Reload**, **Configuration**, **Policy**, and **Monitoring**
actions in the taskbar to manage the selected provider.

**Note:**

Alternatively, click on a cloud provider to see the cloud provider details and its relationships such as Network Manager, Tenants, Instances among others. In Relationships, click Network Manager to see
information about the network provider, and its relationship with the cloud provider, on the summary page.
