==== Creating a Compliance Policy

Create compliance policies by assigning or creating a condition.
CloudForms Management Engine automatically assigns the events and
actions to the compliance policy as opposed to a control policy where
you must define this yourself. The VM or host compliance check event is
assigned to the compliance policy. A compliance policy runs the mark as
compliant action when the virtual machine or host passes all of the
conditions. If any of the conditions are not met, then the virtual
machine or host is marked as non-compliant.

If you do not know how to create a condition, see xref:Creating_a_new_Policy_Condition[]. Carefully plan the
purpose of your policy before creating it. You can also use a scope
expression that is tested immediately when the compliance check event
triggers the policy. If the item is out of scope, then the policy does
not continue on to the conditions, and none of the associated actions
run.

. Navigate to ControlExplorer.

. Click on the Policies accordion, and select VM or host compliances
policies.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (Configuration),

. Type in a Description for the policy.

. Uncheck Active if you do not want this policy processed even when
assigned to a resource.

. You can enter a scope here. (You can also create a scope as part of a
condition, or not use one at all.) If the host or virtual machine is not included in the scope, NO actions run.

. In the Notes area, add a detailed explanation of the policy.

. Click Add.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (Configuration),
image:../images/1875.png[image] (Edit this Policy's Condition assignments).

. Select the required conditions from the Available Conditions box. Use
the Ctrl key to select multiple actions.

. Click image:../images/1876.png[image] (Move selected Conditions into this
Policy).

. Click Save. By default, if ANY of the conditions are false, the virtual
machine is marked as non-compliant.

. To add other actions, such as sending an email if the virtual machine
fails the compliance test, click VM Compliance Check.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (Configuration),
image:../images/1881.png[image] (Edit Actions for this Policy Event).

. Select Stop Virtual Machine and Send Email from the Available Actions
area in Order of Actions if ANY conditions are False. (Mark as
Non-Compliant should already be selected.)

. Click image:../images/1876.png[image] (Move selected Actions into this
Event).

. Click Add.

You can now make this part of a policy profile. After assigning the
policy profile to the virtual machine, you can check it for its
compliance status either on a schedule or on demand.
