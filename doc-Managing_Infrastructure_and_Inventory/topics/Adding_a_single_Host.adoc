= Adding a Single Host

To analyze a host for more detailed information, add it to the VMDB first.
If the host has not been found during [label]#Host Discovery# or [label]#Provider Refresh#, and the host's IP address is known, use the [label]#Add a New Host# button. 

.Procedure: To Add a Single Host
. Navigate to menu:Infrastructure[Hosts]. 
. Click  image:images/1847.png[] btn:[(Configuration)], then click  image:images/1848.png[] btn:[(Add a new Host)]. 
. Type the [label]#Name#, [label]#Host Name#, and [label]#IP Address# of the host to add. [label]#Name# is how the device is labeled in the console.
  Select the type of operating system from the [label]#Host Platform# dropdown.
  If the Host has been found during [label]#Discovery# or [label]#Refresh# and the host's operating system has been identified, the [label]#Host Platform# selector remains disabled.
  If adding an IPMI server for provisioning, add in the IP address of that host.

IMPORTANT: The [label]#Host Name# must use a unique fully qualified domain name.

. In the [label]#Credentials# box, the [label]#Default# tab provides fields to type a user name with elevated security credentials and the user's password.
  If using domain credentials, the format for [label]#User ID# is in the format of [domainname]\[username]. On ESX hosts, if the SSH login is disabled for the [label]#Default# user, type in a user with remote login access on the [label]#Remote Login# tab.
