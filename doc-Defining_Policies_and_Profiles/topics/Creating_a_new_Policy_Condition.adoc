==== Creating a New Policy Condition

If you have not already created a condition to use with this policy, you can create one directly from inside the policy. A condition can contain two elements: a scope, and an expression. The expression is mandatory, but the scope is optional. A scope is a general attribute that is
quickly checked before evaluating a more complex expression. You can create a scope at either the policy or condition level.

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer].

. Click the *Policies* accordion, and select the policy you want to create a new condition for.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), image:../images/1862.png[image] (*Create a new Condition assigned to this Policy*).

. Type in a *Description* for the condition. It must be unique to all the conditions.

display. *Scope* is optional.

* Click *Find* to seek a particular value, and then check a property. For example, finding the Admin account and checking that it is enabled. Use the following check commands:
** *Check Any*: The result is true if one or more of the find results satisfy the check condition.
** *Check All*: All of the find results must match for a true result.
** *Check Count*: If the result satisfies the expression in check count, the result is true.

* Click *Registry* to create criteria based on registry values. For example, you can check if DCOM is enabled on a Windows System. Note that this applies only to Windows operating systems. Registry is only available if you are creating a VM Control Policy.
