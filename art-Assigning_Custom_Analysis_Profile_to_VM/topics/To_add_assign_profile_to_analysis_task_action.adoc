== Creating an Action to Assign the Virtual Machine Analysis Profile to the Analysis Task

Actions are performed after the condition is evaluated. You can associate actions with specific events when you create a policy. {product-title} provides a set of default actions, but you can also create custom actions using the {product-title_short} user interface.

Use this procedure to create a custom action by adding the *Assign Profile to Analysis Task* action type to the virtual machine analysis profile (created in xref:vm-analysis-profile[]).
