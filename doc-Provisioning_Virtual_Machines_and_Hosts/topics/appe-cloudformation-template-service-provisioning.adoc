== Example: Using Amazon CloudFormation Template for Service Provisioning

Cloud orchestration is a service that allows you to create, update, and manage cloud resources and their software components as a single unit and then deploy them in an automated, repeatable way through a template. The deployed instances and associated collection of resources are referred to as stack. {product-title_short} supports Amazon CloudFormation orchestration templates that make deploying complex services easier in the cloud.
