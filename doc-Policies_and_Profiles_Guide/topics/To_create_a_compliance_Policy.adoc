==== Creating a Compliance Policy

Create compliance policies by assigning or creating a condition. {product-title} automatically assigns the events and actions to the compliance policy as opposed to a control policy where you must define this yourself. The entity type (VM or host, for example) compliance check event is
assigned to the compliance policy. A compliance policy runs the mark as compliant action when the virtual machine or host passes all of the conditions. If any of the conditions are not met, then the virtual machine or host is marked as non-compliant.

ifdef::cfme[To create a condition, see xref:Creating_a_new_Policy_Condition[].]
ifdef::miq[If you do not know how to create a condition, see Creating a New Policy Condition.]
Carefully plan the purpose of your policy before creating it. You can also use a scope expression that is tested immediately when the compliance check event
triggers the policy. If the item is out of scope, then the policy does not continue on to the conditions, and none of the associated actions run.

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer].

. Click on the *Policies* accordion, and select *Compliance Policies*.

. Select either *Host Compliance Policies* or *VM Compliance Policies* or *Replicator Compliance Policies* or *Pod Compliance Policies* or *Container Node Compliance Policies* or *Container Image Compliance Policies*.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), image:../images/1862.png[image] (*Add a new Compliance Policy*).

. Type in a *Description* for the policy.

+
. Uncheck *Active* if you do not want this policy processed even when assigned to a resource.

. You can enter a scope here. (You can also create a scope as part of a condition, or not use one at all.) If the host or virtual machine is not included in the scope, no actions run.

. In the *Notes* area, add a detailed explanation of the policy.

. Click *Add*.

You should add one or several conditions:

* You can create a new condition by clicking image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), image:../images/1862.png[image] (*Create a new Condition assigned to this Policy*), as described in xref:Creating_a_new_Policy_Condition[].

* You can use an existing condition by clicking image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), image:../images/1851.png[image] (*Edit this Policy's Condition assignments*), as described in xref:policy-edit-condition-assignment[].

By default, if any of the conditions are false, the virtual machine is marked as non-compliant.
To add other actions, such as sending an email if the virtual machine fails the compliance test:

. Click the *Compliance Check* event under the policy (exact name depends on entity type, for example *VM Compliance Check*).

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), image:../images/1851.png[image] (*Edit Actions for this Policy Event*).

. Select *Stop Virtual Machine* and *Send Email* from the *Available Actions* area in *Order of Actions if ANY conditions are False*. (*Mark as Non-Compliant* should already be selected.)
+

+
. Click image:../images/1876.png[image] (*Move selected Actions into this Event*).

. Click *Add*.

You can now make this part of a policy profile. After assigning the policy profile to the virtual machine, you can check it for its compliance status either on a schedule or on demand.
