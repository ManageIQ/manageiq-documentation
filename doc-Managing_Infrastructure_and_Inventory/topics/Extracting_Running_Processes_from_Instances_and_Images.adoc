= Extracting Running Processes from Instances and Images

CloudForms Management Engine can collect processes running on Windows instances.
To do this, enter domain credentials for the zone where the instance is located.
For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.0/general-configuration/general-configuration[CloudForms General Configuration guide].
The instance must be running and must have an IP address in the VMDB, usually obtained from a SmartState Analysis.
