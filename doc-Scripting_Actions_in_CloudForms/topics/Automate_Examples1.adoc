=== Automate Examples

This chapter describes the ways to invoke an Automate workflow.
Automation can be initiated through an alert, an event, a CloudForms
Management Engine application, or a custom button. The same automation process can be re-used across more than one of these. For example, using automation to remove orphaned virtual machines and instances could be initiated by:

* An administrator request from the CloudForms Management Engine console (from a custom button)
* An alert indicating the datastore has less than 20% free-space
* A virtual machine or instance unregistered event is detected

All invocations of an automate model must enter through the
`/System/Process` namespace.
