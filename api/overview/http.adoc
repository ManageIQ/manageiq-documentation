[[rest-api-entry-point]]
== REST API entry Point

The REST API is made available via the /api URL prefix. It can be
accessed on the Appliance server directly via HTTP using the default
port as follows:

----
http://localhost:3000/api
----

Or external to the Appliance as follows:

----
https://<applianceHost_fqdn>/api
----

=== Response:

[source,json]
----
{
  "name" : "API",
  "description" : "REST API",
  "version" : "2.0.0",
  "versions" : [
    {
      "name" : "2.0.0",
      "href" : "http://localhost:3000/api/v2.0.0"
    }
  ],
  "collections" : [
    {
      "name" : "providers",
      "href" : "http://localhost:3000/api/providers",
      "description" : "Providers"
    },
    {
      "name" : "vms",
      "href" : "http://localhost:3000/api/vms",
      "description" : "Virtual Machines"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
----

* Version is the Current API version, accessible via either of the following:
* /api/
* /api/v2.0.0/
* Versions lists current and any earlier API versions that are still exposed via their respective entry points:
* /api/v**Version**/

[[url-paths]]
== URL Paths

The recommended convention for URLs is to use alternate collection /
resource path segments, relative to the API entry point as described in
the following example:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|URL |Description
|/api |The REST API Entrypoint
|/api/v**Version** |The REST Entrypoint for a specific version of the REST API
|/api/:collection |A top-level collection
|/api/:collection/:id |A specific resource of that collection
|/api/:collection/:id/:subcollection |Sub-collection under the specific resource
|=======================================================================

[[methods-and-related-urls]]
== Methods and related URLs

The basic HTTP Methods used for the API are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|URL |Semantic
|GET /api/:collection |Return all resources of the collection
|GET /api/:collection/:id |Return the specific resource
|POST /api/:collection |Create a resource in the collection
|POST /api/:collection/:id |Perform an Action on a resource in the collection
|PUT /api/:collection/:id |Update a specific resource
|PATCH /api/:collection/:id |Update a specific resource
|DELETE /api/:collection/:id |Delete a specific resource
|=======================================================================

There :collection represent specific Appliance entities like services,
hosts, vms, etc.

[[updating-resources]]
== Updating resources

As shown in the above table, there are a couple of way to update
attributes in a resource. These are:
* Update a resource via the PUT HTTP Method
* Update a resource via a POST Method with an _edit_ action.
* Update a resource via the PATCH HTTP Method

While the PUT is the common method, the PATCH mechanism gives better
control on which attribute to edit, add as well as remove which is not
available with the other two methods.

[[return-codes]]
== Return Codes

* <<success,Success>>
* <<client-errors,Client Errors>>
* <<server-errors,Server Errors>>

[[success]]
=== Success

* *200 OK* - The request has succeeded without errors, this code should
be returned for example when retrieving a collection or a single
resource.
* *201 Created* - The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a *new
resource being created*. The resource is available before this status
code is returned. The response includes the HTTP body of the newly
created resource.
* *202 Accepted* - The request has been accepted for processing, but the
processing has not been completed. Like, resource is not fully available
yet. This status code is usually returned when the resource creation
happens asynchronously. In this case the HTTP response includes a
pointer to _monitor_ or a _job_ where the client can query to get the
current status of the request and the estimate on when the request will
be actually fulfilled.
* *204 No Content* - The server has fulfilled the request but does not
need to return an entity-body, and might want to return updated meta
information. This HTTP response is commonly used for the DELETE
requests, as the resource that was deleted does not exists anymore.

[[client-errors]]
=== Client Errors

* *400 Bad Request* - The request could not be understood by the server
due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request
without modifications. In REST API this status code should be returned
to client when the client use the wrong combination of attributes, like
expanding the non-existing collection, or using the pagination parameter
incorrectly. Another use-case could be creating or performing actions on
the resource, when the wrong JSON serialization of the resource or
action is used.
* *401 Unauthorized* - The request requires user authentication. The
response MUST include a _Authenticate_ header field containing a
challenge applicable to the requested resource. If the request include
_Authenticate_ header, then this HTTP status code might indicate that
the current user is *not authorized* to perform given action or to
access given resource.
* *403 Forbidden* - The server understood the request, but is refusing
to fulfill it. Authorization will not help in this case. This HTTP
status code might indicate that the action performed is not supported
for this resource or collection.
* *404 Not Found* - In this case, the server has not found anything that
matches with the URL.
* *415 Unsupported Media Type* - The server is refusing to service the
request because the entity of the request is in a format not supported
by the requested resource for the requested method. This error must be
returned, when the client is explicitly asking for format other than
JSON (application/json).

[[server-errors]]
=== Server Errors

* *500 Internal Server Error* - The server encountered an unexpected
condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. This error
code must be used when an exception is raised in the application and the
exception has nothing to do with the client request.
