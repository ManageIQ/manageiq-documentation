= Migration logs

The conversion host logs and the CloudForms migration log can help with troubleshooting.

== Conversion host logs

When disk migration starts, two logs are created in the conversion host:

* `virt-v2v`: Debug output from `virt-v2v` itself. This log tracks the core of the virtual machine migration process, including `libguestfs` traces and disk migration details.
* `virt-v2v-wrapper`: Log of the daemonizing wrapper for `virt-v2v`. This log traces the orchestration of the virtual machine conversion on the conversion host, including disk migration percentages and `virt-v2v` error reporting.

For more information about the functions of `virt-v2v` and `virt-v2v-wrapper`, see the migration workflows:

* xref:Vmware_to_rhv_migration_workflow[]
* xref:Vmware_to_osp_migration_workflow[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you need to open a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/new[Red Hat Support call], you must submit both the migration (`virt-v2v`) log and `virt-v2v-wrapper` log for analysis.
====

.Accessing the `virt-v2v` and `virt-v2v-wrapper` logs on the conversion host

. Log in to the conversion host using SSH. If you have multiple conversion hosts, you can view the name of a virtual machine's conversion host by clicking the information icon (image:Info_icon.png[20]) of the virtual machine in the migration plan's details view.

. Go to `/var/log/vdsm/import/` to access the logs for each migration:
+
* `virt-v2v` log: +v2v-import-_date_-_log_number_.log+
* `virt-v2v-wrapper` log: +v2v-import-_date_-_log_number_-wrapper.log+

.Downloading the `virt-v2v` log in CloudForms

. Click menu:Compute[*Migration* > Migration Plans].
. Click a completed migration plan to view its details.
. Click menu:Download Log[Migration Log].

[id="CloudForms_log"]
== CloudForms migration log

This log traces the orchestration of the virtual machine migration in CloudForms.

.Accessing the CloudForms migration log

. Log in to the CloudForms machine using SSH.
. View the migration log, `/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log`.
