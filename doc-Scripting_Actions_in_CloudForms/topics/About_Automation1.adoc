=== Automation

CloudForms Management Engine Automate Model provides flexibility to not
only change parts of the provisioning process, but also to allow you to
automate other operational tasks. Below are some scenarios where
CloudForms Management Engine can help accomplish these tasks.

* Intelligent Workload Management - An enterprise had a requirement that
when a virtual machine has reached a High CPU Percent Ready for a
specified period of time, a vMotion should occur to a more suitable
host. For this reason, VMware's Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) was
not practical, as the CPU Ready metric could not trigger DRS. The
solution was to leverage CloudForms Management Engine Control and
CloudForms Management Engine Automate to drive the management of this
workflow.
* Power on only during business hours - An organization which gave a
group of self-service users CloudForms Management Engine access had a
requirement to only allow certain virtual machines to be powered during
business hours. This was solved with CloudForms Management Engine
Automate.
* Auto-Tagging virtual machines based on file contents - An IT
organization needed a way to consume information from a text file on a
virtual machine and dynamically populate vCenter. The data used to
auto-tag virtual machines is also used to align unmanaged virtual
machines to the business.
