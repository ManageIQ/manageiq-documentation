== Red Hat Access Insights

*Red Hat Access Insights* is a new service that uses the collective knowledge to help end users proactively diagnose systems and avoid critical downtime situations. Red Hat Access Insights does this by having systems periodically check in similar to Red Hat Subscription Management.

Red Hat Access Insights provides an easy to use dashboard that enables system administrators and IT operations managers to quickly identify key risks to stability, security, or performance. A glance at the display allows users to sort by category, view details of the impact and resolution, and then quickly determine what systems are affected.

/////////////////////////////////
With daily or weekly check ins, Red Hat Access Insights provides a dashboard of what is happening with your systems. The interface displays specific stability, security, and performance issues in affected systems, and offers clear remediation steps. With that knowledge in hand you can then resolve the critical issue and avoid future impact.

Using over 20,000 solutions from Red Hat Certified Engineers, Red Hat Access Insights does more than traditional security and performance tools that only check for installed packages. By cross referencing data and our knowledge you can know how you might be affected and get a real solution to your problem.

By spending less time on critical interruptions, your team can focus its resources on the future and achieving your business goals. As budgets for IT tighten, Red Hat Access Insights acts as a software service to help offload costly and time consuming research periods that can slow down your team.

[[rh-insights-rules]]
=== Rules Tab

Rules enable easy addition of rules which operate on customer uploaded archives. It allows developers to focus on a single archive at a time while being able to process large amounts of data.

==== States

For management purposes, rules may be placed under one of four active states:

* *Active* - Rules which have been pushed to the master branch, are in prod and the content has been approved. This is the only state where the rules are displayed to customers.

* *Needs Content* - Plugins that the system has identified are in our master branch, hits have been found but do not have an entry / content written for them.

* *Inactive* - Once a rule is created from Needs Content, it will by default move to Inactive. Inactive can be used as a staging area as rules are written or to temporarily remove an active rule from the customer's view if further work needs to be completed. Rules can be deleted in this state

* *Retired* - Plugins or error info entries which are no longer in use. - Rules can be deleted in this state

==== Info Listed

You will find the following information available for each rule on the list

* *Error Key* - The returned key the plugin provides to alert detection.
* *Plugin* - Name of the plugin located in the master branch, ex: plugin.swappiness == plugins/swappiness.py
* *Description* - The 50 character "title" the customer sees during the drill down of issues.
* *Category* - Security, Stability, Performance.
* *Severity* - Warn, Error, Info.
* *Count* - The current amount of hosts the plugin has been detected by when the rules last ran.
