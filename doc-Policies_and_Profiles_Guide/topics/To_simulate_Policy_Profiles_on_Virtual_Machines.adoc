. The virtual machine thumbnail displays in the *Policy Simulation* area.

* A check sign in the lower right quadrant of the virtual thumbnail shows that the virtual machine passes policy.
* A minus sign in the lower right quadrant of the virtual thumbnail shows that the virtual machine fails policy.

. Click on a virtual machine in the *Policy Simulation* area to see its details.

. Expand a policy profile by clicking on it to see its member policies and the status of the conditions.

* Check *Show out of scope items* to show all conditions, whether or not the virtual machine passes the scope part of the condition. Uncheck it to hide conditions where the scope part fails.
* Next to *Show policies*, check *Successful* to show policies that are passed and check *Failed* to see the policies that have failed. The default is to show both.
* Items in green text passed the condition.
* Items in red text failed the condition.
* Items in red italics failed the condition, but do not change the outcome of the scope.

If you evaluate multiple policy profiles, you can see both policy profiles and a tree expanding down to their conditions.
