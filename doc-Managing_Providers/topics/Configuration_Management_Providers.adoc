= Configuration Management Providers

Currently, {product-title} has two configuration management providers integrated in it to review and monitor the configuration items and changes to them to eliminate the confusion and error brought about by the existence of different providers. These configuration systems are used for recording and reporting status and change activity for these configuration items.

== Red Hat Satellite 6

Satellite 6 is a subscription and system management tool that provides a way to provision hosts (both virtual and bare metal) and configure them using a set of Puppet modules. {product-title} provides functionality to integrate with a Red Hat Satellite 6 server and take advantage of its features. This includes:

* Monitoring the inventory of your Red Hat Satellite 6 server, including independent hosts and hosts provisioned using hostgroups.
* Reprovisioning existing bare metal system hosts to new host groups.
* Applying {product-title} policy tags to hosts.

[IMPORTANT]
======
{product-title} only reprovisions existing systems in a Red Hat Satellite 6 environment. Provisioning systems from Red Hat Satellite 6's bare metal discovery service is planned for a future release.

== Ansible Tower

Ansible Tower is a management tool integrated with {product-title}, designed to help automate infrastructure operations. {product-title} allows you to execute Ansible Tower jobs using service catalogs and Automate. No custom configuration or Ruby scripting is needed in {product-title}, as configuration is done in Ansible Tower using playbooks. 

You can use the large library of existing Ansible playbooks as {product-title} state machines to automate tasks such as backups, package updates, and maintenance in your {product-title} environment. This also includes deploying Red Hat Satellite agents on bare metal machines as required. This can be particularly useful for quickly applying changes across large environments with many virtual machines or instances. Using Ansible Tower, you can schedule Ansible playbook runs and monitor current and historical results, allowing for troubleshooting or identification of issues before they occur.

The basic workflow when using {product-title} with an Ansible Tower provider is as follows:

. Create an Ansible playbook which performs a specific task.
. A new Ansible Tower job template is created from the playbook, which is then retrieved by {product-title}.
. From the Ansible Tower job template, create a new catalog item in {product-title}, optionally with a service dialog that allows the user to enter parameters if needed.
. The user orders the service from the {product-title} user interface, and fills out any additional arguments (for example, limiting the task to run on a specific set of virtual machines). 
. The job executes.


[NOTE]
======
For more information on Ansible playbooks, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html[Ansible documentation].
======

=== Adding an Ansible Tower Provider

To access your Ansible Tower inventory from {product-title}, you must add Ansible Tower as a provider. 

. Navigate to menu:Configuration[Configuration Management > Providers].
. Under image:1847.png[Configuration] *Configuration*, click  image:1862.png[Add a new Provider] *Add a new Provider*.

. In the *Add a new Configuration Management Provider* area:
+
image:Add_Ansible_Provider.png[Add_Ansible_Provider]
+
.. Enter a *Name* for the new provider.
.. In the *Type* field, select *Ansible Tower* from the list.
.. Enter the *URL* location or IP address to the Ansible Tower server.
. Select the *Verify Peer Certificate* checkbox if desired.
. In the *Credentials* area, provide the *Username* and *Password*, and *Confirm Password*.
. Click *Add*.

After adding the Ansible Tower provider, refresh its relationships and power states in order to view the current inventory.


=== Refreshing an Ansible Tower Provider

Refresh relationships of all items related to an existing Ansible Tower configuration management provider including inventory, hosts, virtual machines, and clusters.

You can refresh inventory from {product-title}, or by enabling the *Update on Launch* option for inventory groups in Ansible Tower. The *Update on Launch* option allows Ansible Tower to automatically update inventory using a dynamic inventory script before launching an Ansible Tower job from a playbook. See the link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/index.html[Ansible Tower documentation] for more information.

[IMPORTANT]
======
It can take a long time to retrieve information from providers containing many virtual machines or instances. The Ansible Tower dynamic inventory script can be modified to limit updates to specific items and reduce refresh time. 
======

To refresh an Ansible Tower provider's inventory in {product-title}:

. Navigate to menu:Configuration[Configuration Management > Providers].
. Select the checkboxes for the Ansible Tower providers to refresh under *All Ansible Tower Providers*.
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), and then image:2003.png[Refresh Relationships and Power States] (*Refresh Relationships and Power States*).
. Click *OK*.

{product-title} then queries the Ansible Tower API and obtains an inventory of all available hosts and job templates.

=== Viewing Ansible Tower Providers and Inventory

{product-title} automatically updates its inventory from Ansible Tower. This includes system groups (known as Inventories in Ansible Tower), basic information about individual systems, and available Ansible Tower job templates to be executed from the service catalog or Automate.

[NOTE]
======
To view and access Ansible Tower inventories and job templates in {product-title}, you must first create them in Ansible Tower. 
======

To view a list of Ansible Tower providers and inventory:

. Navigate to menu:Configuration[Configuration Management > Providers].
. Under *All Configuration Manager Providers*, select the *Ansible Tower Providers* accordion menu to display a list of providers. 
. Select your Ansible Tower provider to expand and list the inventory groups on that Ansible Tower system. The inventory groups can be expanded to view the systems contained within each group, as well as configuration details for these systems.

Similarly, all discovered job templates are accessed under the provider by expanding the menu:Configuration[Configuration Management > Ansible Tower Job Templates] accordion menu.


=== Viewing Ansible Tower Configured Systems

To view the systems in your Ansible Tower inventory:

. Navigate to menu:Configuration[Configuration Management > Configured Systems].
. Under *All Configured Systems*, select *Ansible Tower Configured Systems* to display a list.

=== Executing an Ansible Tower Job Template from a {product-title} Service Catalog

You can execute an Ansible Tower playbook from {product-title} by creating a service catalog item from an Ansible Tower job template. 

[IMPORTANT]
======
You must first create the job template in Ansible Tower. The job templates are automatically discovered by {product-title} when refreshing your Ansible Tower providerâ€™s inventory. 
======

First, create a catalog:

. Navigate to menu:Services[Catalogs].
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then  image:1862.png[Add a New Catalog] (*Add a New Catalog*)
. Enter a *Name* and *Description* for the catalog.
. Click *Add*.

Then, create an Ansible Tower service catalog item:

. Navigate to menu:Configuration[Configuration Management].
. Click *Ansible Tower Job Templates* and select an Ansible Tower job template.
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then  image:1862.png[Create Service Dialog from this Job Template] (*Create Service Dialog from this Job Template*).
. Enter a *Service Dialog Name* (for example, _ansible_tower_job_)and click *Save*.
. Navigate to menu:Services[Catalogs]. Click *Catalog Items*.
.  Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then  image:1862.png[Add a New Catalog Item] (*Add a New Catalog Item*) to create a new catalog item with the following details, at minimum:
- For *Catalog Item type*, select *Ansible Tower*.
- Enter a *Name* for the service catalog item.
- Select *Display in Catalog*.
- In *Catalog*, select the catalog you created previously.
- In *Dialog*, select the service dialog you created previously (in this example, _ansible_tower_job_). *No Dialog* can be selected if the playbook does not require extra variables from the user. To ask the user to enter extra information when running the task, *Service Dialog* must be selected. 
- In *Provider*, select your Ansible Tower provider. This brings up the *Ansible Tower Job Template* option and configures the *Provisioning Entry Point State Machine* automatically.
- Select your desired *Ansible Tower Job Template* from the list. Generally, this is the Ansible Tower job template previously used to create the service dialog.
+
image:Add_AT_Service_Catalog_Item.png[]
+
. Click *Add*. The catalog item you created will appear in the *All Service Catalog Items* list.


To execute the Ansible Tower job:

. Navigate to menu:Service Catalogs[Ansible Tower catalog].
+
image:Order_AT_Catalog_Item.png[]
+
. Click *Order* for the catalog item.
. Enter any variables requested and click *Submit*.

{product-title} takes you to the *Requests* queue page and show the status of the job.

The service item's details can be viewed in menu:Services[My Services] in {product-title}.

[NOTE]
======
Instead of running a single job at a time, multiple service catalog items can also be grouped together as a catalog bundle to create one deployment with multiple job templates. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-{product-title}/4.1/provisioning-virtual-machines-and-hosts/chapter-5-catalogs-and-services[Catalogs and Services] in _Provisioning Virtual Machines and Hosts_ for more information.
======


=== Executing an Ansible Tower Job Using a Custom Automate Button

{product-title} can execute Ansible Tower jobs on virtual machines or instances using custom buttons in Automate.

Ansible Tower jobs can either be non-customizable, which do not require any extra configuration from the user, or alternatively, they can allow the user to specify a parameter (for example, a package name to install). In Ansible Tower jobs containing a dialog, {product-title} accepts additional  information from the user and adds it to the appropriate API call in Automate, and then sends it into Ansible Tower.

.Prerequisites

Before creating an Automate button to execute an Ansible Tower job, the following must be configured:

* An Ansible playbook in Ansible Tower. See the link:https://docs.ansible.com/[Ansible Tower documentation] for instructions.
* Ansible Tower must be able reach virtual machines or instances deployed by {product-title} at the IP level.
* The virtual machine template must have the Ansible Tower environment's public SSH key injected. For cloud instances, `cloud-init` can be used and the public SSH key can be passed without rebuilding the image.
* Any dynamic inventory scripts used must be configured to return the virtual machine names exactly as they are stored in {product-title}, without the UUID appended.

.Executing an Ansible Tower Job using a Custom Automate Button

To configure a custom button to execute an Ansible Tower job on a virtual machine or instance, first create the button:

. Navigate to menu:Automate[Customization].
. Click the *Buttons* accordion menu.
. Click menu:VM and Instance[Unassigned Buttons]. This configures the button to run on virtual machines or instances.
. Click  image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), then click  image:1862.png[] (*Add a new Button*). 
  * In the *Adding a new Button* screen, configure the *Action* parameters as desired. *Dialog* can be left blank if the playbook does not require extra variables. To ask the user to enter extra information when running the task, *Service Dialog* must be selected.
  * Configure *Object Details* fields with the following request details:
    ** For *System/Process*, select *Request*.
    ** For *Message*, enter *create*.
    ** For *Request*, enter *Ansible_Tower_Job*. 
  * Configure *Attribute/Value Pairs* with the following parameters:
    ** *job_template_name* is the Ansible Tower job template name to associate with the button. The *job_template_name* field is mandatory; other parameters are provided by the Tower job dialog.
  * Configure *Visibility* to all users, or limit visibility by role as desired.
+
image:Add_button.png[]
+
  * Click *Add*.

If you do not have an existing button group to assign the new button to, create a new button group:

. From menu:Automate[Customization], navigate to menu:Buttons[VM and Instance > Add a new Button Group], and configure the following:
  * Configure *Basic Info* as desired. For example, name the button group `VM Actions`.
  * In *Assign Buttons*, select the button you just created from the *Unassigned* list and click image:1876.png[] to assign it to *Selected*.
+
image:Create_button_group.png[]
+
  * Click *Add*.

To assign the button to an existing button group:

. Navigate to menu:Buttons[VM and Instance > VM Actions > Edit this Button Group].
. In *Assign Buttons*, select the button you just created from the *Unassigned* list and click image:1876.png[] to assign it to *Selected*.
. Click *Add*.

To use the button to run an Ansible Tower job on a virtual machine:

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Virtual Machines].
. Select the virtual machine to run the Ansible Tower job template on.
. Click the *VM Actions* button to show the button you created, and click the button from the list to run the Ansible Tower job template.
+
image:Run_Update_Button.png[]
+
. Click *Submit* to execute the job.

{product-title} then confirms the job has been executed. 

If you selected a service dialog to run when creating the button, {product-title} will then prompt you to enter variables to complete the task. After entering your desired parameters, {product-title} takes you to the *Requests* page.

The service item's details can be viewed in menu:Services[My Services] in {product-title}.
