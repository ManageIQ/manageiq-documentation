* BZ#1726939: link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1726939[Run the preflight check of migration task before waiting for a conversion host]. Currently, the preflight check that monitors the migration is performed after a conversion host is assigned to the task. As a result, the total volume of the datastores reported in *Migration Plans In Progress* reflects the total volume of the virtual machines that are currently migrating, not the total volume of the migration plan. When all the virtual machines have started to migrate, the correct value of the total volume is displayed.
