// update starts here
. In the *Default* tab of the *Endpoints* section, enter the fully qualified domain name of the provider in the *Hostname (or IPv4 or IPv6 address)* field.

. Click *Validate* to confirm that the {product-title} can connect to the OpenShift Enterprise provider using the provided token.
