### Deleting a Report

Delete reports when you find that they are no longer useful. Only
administrators and super administrators of {{ site.data.product.title_short }} can add,
copy, edit, and delete reports.

**Note:**

Please note that only customer-created reports can be deleted.

1.  Navigate to **Overview > Reports**.

2.  Click the **Reports > All Reports** accordion and select the
    report you want to delete.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**),
    ![1861](../images/1861.png) (**Delete this Report from the
    Database**).

    **Note:**

    The **Delete this report from the Database** option will only appear
    on reports you have created. Default reports cannot be deleted.

4.  Click **OK**.
