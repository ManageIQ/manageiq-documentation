== Using a Non-Administrator Account for Host Credentials

After adding a VMware vCenter infrastructure provider, you must authenticate its hosts to enable full functionality. You can use administrator credentials, or create another user assigned to a role (See the VMware documentation for instructions on how to create a role) created for {product-title}. The following privileges should be enabled for the non-administrator user:

From the Global group, check:

* Cancel task
* Diagnostics
* Log Event
* Set custom attribute
* Settings

The entire set of privileges for the following groups should be checked:

* Alarms
* Datastores
* dvPort Group
* Host
* Network
* Resource
* Scheduled Task
* Tasks
* Virtual Machine
* vSphere Distributed Switch

Additionally, you must assign the new role to the following objects:

* *Datacenter*: At the Datacenter the {product-title} user/group must have at least the read-only role at the Datacenter level (Not Propagated) to be able to see the datacenter. Without this access, relationships cannot be made. Specifically, the datastores will not show up.
* *Cluster*: Each Cluster that the {product-title} needs access to must have the new role assigned and propagated.
* *Folders*: Each Folder that {product-title} needs access to must have the new role assigned and propagated.
* *Datastores*: Each Datastore that {product-title} needs access to must have the new role assigned and propagated.
* *Networking*: Each vLAN or Port Group that {product-title} needs access to must have the new role assigned and propagated.
