= Virtual Machine or Template Summary

When you click on a specific virtual machine or template, you will see the *Virtual Thumbnail*, and an operating system-specific screen of the item, called the *Summary*.
Where applicable, click on a subcategory of the *Summary* to see more detail on that section.

==== 
When you perform a SmartState Analysis on a virtual machine or template, you get more detailed information in these categories. 
====
* *Properties* include information such as the base operating system, hostname, IP addresses, Virtual Machine vendor, CPU Affinity, devices attached to the system, and snapshots.
  This includes the ability to analyze multiple partitions, multiple disks, Linux logical volumes, extended partitions, and Windows drives.
  Some categories can be clicked on for additional detail.
  For example, click *Container* to view notes associated with a virtual machine.

* *Power Management* displays the current power state, last boot time, and last power state change. *State Changed On* is the date that the virtual machine last changed its power state.
  This is a container view of the power state, therefore a restart of the operating system does not cause the container power state to change and will not update this value.

* *Security* includes information on users, groups, and security patches.
  Recall that the items shown on the *Summary* screen change based on the guest operating system.
