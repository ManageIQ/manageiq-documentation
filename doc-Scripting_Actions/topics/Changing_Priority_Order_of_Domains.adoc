=== Changing Priority Order of Domains

Functions are executed depending on the order of Domain priority. Use
this procedure to change the priority order of domains.

. Navigate to menu:Automate[Explorer]. The default view is the Datastore.

. Select the Domains you want to change the priority order for.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), then
image:../images/1851.png[image] (*Edit Priority Order of Domains*).

. The list of Domains selected shows up. Note that you cannot change the
priority of locked Domains and therefore locked Domains do not show up
on the list.

. Select one or more consecutive groups to move up or down to change their
priority as required.

. Click *Save*.
