## Configuring Image Scanning

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} manages vulnerability scanning of container images. When
an OpenShift provider is added, OpenShift images from the internal
registry are discovered. To enable image scanning, perform the following
configuration steps:

1.  Browse to menu: **Compute > Containers > Providers**.

2.  Select the checkboxes of the OpenShift providers on which to enable
    scanning.

3.  From the **Policy** pull-down menu, click **Manage Policies**.

4.  Select the **OpenSCAP profile** checkbox.

5.  Click **Save**.

This action will trigger a SmartState analysis, or scan, of all images
referenced by the OpenShift provider. The initial scan may take several
hours to complete, depending on the number and size of images. The scan
occurs in the OpenShift provider, which {{ site.data.product.title_short }} receives
and records in the database. OpenShift limits the number of scanning
pods; only three images can be scanned simultaneously.

## Scheduling A Recurring Scan

Software vulnerability databases are updated frequently. To apply these
updates, a rescan is required. To schedule a recurring scan of container
images:

![:schedule openscap scan](../images/:schedule_openscap_scan.png)

1.  Click **Configuration**.

2.  From **Settings > Zones** in the left pane of the appliance,
    select **Schedules**.

3.  From the drop-down menu, click **Configuration > Add a new
    Schedule**.

4.  Type an arbitrary **Name**.

5.  Type an arbitrary **Description**.

6.  Ensure the **Active** checkbox is selected.

7.  In **Action**, select **Container Image Analysis**.

8.  In **Filter**, select **All Container Images for Containers
    Provider**, **OpenShift**.

9.  In **Run**, set the schedule as desired.

10. Set the **Time Zone**, **Starting Date**, and **Starting Time**.

11. Click **Add**.

## Working with Images

### Viewing Results

Image scanning results are displayed in each image summary page.

1.  Select menu: **Compute > Containers > Container Images**.

2.  Click the desired image.

For an OpenSCAP HTML report, locate the **Configuration** section and
select **OpenSCAP HTML**.

![:container configuration](../images/:container_configuration.png)

For compliance and scanning history information, locate the
**Compliance** section and note the **Status** field or select
**Available** from the **History** field.

![:container scan history](../images/:container_scan_history.png)

### Manual Scanning

SmartState analysis scanning may be initiated manually for images. From
an image summary page, select **Configuration > Perform SmartState
Analysis**. Refreshing the image page will reflect the latest scan
results and compliance history.

### Evaluating Compliance

If the image scan policy has been updated since the last scan,
compliance conditions may be re-evaluated. From an image summary page,
select **Policy > Check Compliance of Last Known Configuration**.
Refreshing the image page will reflect the latest compliance history.

### Generating a Report on Images

{% include openscap/generating-openscap-report-failed-images.md %}

## OpenSCAP Policy Profile

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} is pre-configured with a default scanning policy
profile. This includes conditions to scan and identify compliance, as
well as annotate compliance failure. SmartState analysis is performed
when new images are added to OpenShift.

### Customizing the Scanning Policy Profile

{% include openscap/creating-custom-openscap-policy-profile.md %}

## Controlling OpenShift Pod Execution

Through the default policy profile, non-compliant images receive the
control policy action **Mark as Non-Compliant**. This action annotates
the **image** object (not to be confused with the **imagestream**
object) with *images.openshift.io/deny-execution=true*. This annotation
may be used to prevent nodes from running non-compliant images.
