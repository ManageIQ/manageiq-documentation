= Cloud Providers

In {product-title_short}, a cloud provider is a cloud computing environment that you can add to a {product-title_short} appliance to manage and interact with the resources in that environment. This chapter describes the different types of cloud providers that you can add to {product-title_short}, and how to manage them. Most cloud providers are added individually to {product-title_short}. Additionally, Amazon EC2 and Azure cloud providers can be discovered automatically by {product-title_short}.

The web interface uses virtual thumbnails to represent cloud providers.
Each thumbnail contains four quadrants by default, which display basic information about each provider:
