.Workload migration summary

This section describes the complexity of the migration and provides detailed workload data. A pie chart displays the complexity of migrations:

* *Easy*: Virtual machine with no unusual configuration
* *Medium*: For example, virtual machine with more than four vNICs or a shared disk
* *Hard*: For example, a virtual machine with Raw Device Mapping
* *Unsupported*: Operating system is not supported for migration, for example, FreeBSD 12

.Workload migration inventory

This section displays a list of the virtual machines to be migrated, with detailed information about each virtual machine's workload, operating system, estimated migration effort, and recommended migration targets.
