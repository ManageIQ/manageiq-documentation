= Creating a `RHEL premigration` playbook for RHEL/Linux source virtual machines

If you are migrating virtual machines running RHEL or other Linux operating system, you can create a `RHEL premigration` playbook to ensure that the IP addresses are accessible after migration. The `RHEL premigration` playbook calls the Ansible `ims.rhel_premigration` role.

To install the role with Ansible Galaxy, see link:https://galaxy.ansible.com/fdupont_redhat/ims_rhel_pre_migration[ims_rhel_pre_migration]. This role is not included in the IMS installation.

The `ims.rhel_premigration` role performs the following tasks on the VMware virtual machines:

* Preserves the static IP address configuration by creating udev rules to associate the virtual machine's MAC address with its interface name
ifdef::rhv[]
* Installs the Red Hat Virtualization guest agent. The guest agent reports the new virtual machine's IP address and installed applications to the Manager.
endif::rhv[]

[NOTE]
====
The `ims.rhel_premigration` role assumes that either the `rhel-6-server-rpms` or the `rhel-7-server-rpms` repository is enabled in the source virtual machine when it installs `qemu-guest-agent`. If you have disabled the repository, re-enable it in the RHEL premigration playbook.
