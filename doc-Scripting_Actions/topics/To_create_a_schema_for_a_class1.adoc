=== Creating a Schema for a Class

This procedure shows you how to create a schema.

. Navigate to menu:Automate[Explorer], and click the class you want to define a schema for.

. Click on the *Schema* tab.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), then
image:../images/1851.png[image] (*Edit selected Schema*).

. Click image:../images/2366.png[image] (*Click to add a new field*) to create a new field.

. Type in a *Name* for the new field.

. From *Type*, select *Assertion*, *Attribute*, *Method*, *Relationship*, or *State*.

. If applicable, select a *Data Type* and set a *Default Value*.

. Type in a user friendly *Display Name* and *Description*.

. Check *Sub* to enable the substitution syntax of `${}`. Uncheck it if you
want to use that syntax as a regular string.

. Fill in *Collect* and *Message* as required. *Collect* is used to roll up
values from resolved relationships. For example, a relationship can
resolve to a large object tree. Use *collect* to specify how to pull out
data from those child objects into the current object. If you give
*collect* a name value, it will store the method result in an attribute of
the current object with that name.

. *On Entry*, *On Exit*, *On Error*, *Max Retries*, and *Max Time* are fields used mostly for state machines. Leave blank if not applicable.

. Click image:../images/1863.png[image] (*Add this entry*) to confirm the
fields values.

. For each new field, repeat steps 4 through 10.

. When you have created all of the fields, click *Save*.

The class schema is created, and you can now add instances to it.

[NOTE]
====
You may need to edit a class schema to reorder, add, edit, or remove a
field. Classes define the order in which fields are processed and you
may need to process some items before others.
