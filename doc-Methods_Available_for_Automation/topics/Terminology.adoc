== Terminology

Account Role::
  A designation assigned to a user allowing or restricting a user to
  parts and functions of the {product-title} console.
Action::
  An execution that is performed after a condition is evaluated.
Alert::
  {product-title} alerts notify administrators and
  monitoring systems of critical configuration changes and threshold
  limits in the virtual environment. The notification can take the form
  of either an email or an SNMP trap.
Analysis Profile::
  A customized scan of hosts, virtual machines, or instances. You can
  collect information from categories, files, event logs, and registry
  entries.
Cloud::
  A pool of on-demand and highly available computing resources. The
  usage of these resources are scaled depending on the user requirements
  and metered for cost.
{product-title} appliance::
  A virtual machine on which the virtual management database (VMDB) and
  {product-title} server reside.
{product-title} Console::
  A web-based interface into the {product-title} appliance.
{product-title} Role::
  A designation assigned to a {product-title} server that
  defines what a {product-title} server can do.
{product-title} Server::
  The application that runs on the {product-title}
  appliance and communicates with the SmartProxy and the VMDB.
Cluster::
  Hosts that are grouped together to provide high availability and load
  balancing.
Condition::
  A test of criteria triggered by an event.
Discovery::
  Process run by the {product-title} server which finds
  virtual machine and cloud providers.
Drift::
  The comparison of a virtual machine, instance, host, cluster to itself
  at different points in time.
Event::
  A trigger to check a condition.
Event Monitor::
  Software on the {product-title} appliance which monitors
  external providers for events and sends them to the {product-title} server.
Host::
  A computer on which virtual machine monitor software is loaded.
Instance/Cloud Instance::
  A on-demand virtual machine based upon a predefined image and uses a
  scalable set of hardware resources such as CPU, memory, networking
  interfaces.
Managed/Registered VM::
  A virtual machine that is connected to a host and exists in the VMDB.
  Also, a template that is connected to a provider and exists in the
  VMDB. Note that templates cannot be connected to a host.
Managed/Unregistered VM::
  A virtual machine or template that resides on a repository or is no
  longer connected to a provider or host and exists in the VMDB. A
  virtual machine that was previously considered registered may become
  unregistered if the virtual machine was removed from provider
  inventory.
Provider::
  A computer on which software is loaded which manages multiple virtual
  machines that reside on multiple hosts.
Policy::
  A combination of an event, a condition, and an action used to manage a
  virtual machine.
Policy Profile::
  A set of policies.
Refresh::
  A process run by the {product-title} server which checks
  for relationships of the provider or host to other resources, such as
  storage locations, repositories, virtual machines, or instances. It
  also checks the power states of those resources.
Regions::
  Regions are used to create a central database for reporting and
  charting. Regions are used primarily to consolidate multiple VMDBs
  into one master VMDB for reporting.
Resource::
  A host, provider, instance, virtual machine, repository, or datastore.
Resource Pool::
  A group of virtual machines across which CPU and memory resources are
  allocated.
Repository::
  A place on a datastore resource which contains virtual machines.
SmartProxy::
* The SmartProxy is a software agent that acts on behalf of the {product-title} appliance to perform actions on hosts, providers, storage and virtual machines.
* The SmartProxy can be configured to reside on the {product-title} appliance or on an ESX server version. 
* The SmartProxy can be deployed from the {product-title} appliance, and provides visibility to the VMFS storage. Each storage location must have a SmartProxy with visibility to it. The SmartProxy acts on behalf of the {product-title} appliance. 
* If the SmartProxy is not embedded in the {product-title} server, it communicates with the {product-title} appliance over HTTPS on standard port 443.
SmartState Analysis::
  Process run by the SmartProxy which collects the details of a virtual
  machine or instance. Such details include accounts, drivers, network
  information, hardware, and security patches. This process is also run
  by the {product-title} server on hosts and clusters. The
  data is stored in the VMDB.
SmartTags::
  Descriptors that allow you to create a customized, searchable index
  for the resources in your clouds and infrastructure.
Storage Location::
  A device, such as a VMware datastore, where digital information
  resides that is connected to a resource.
Tags::
  Descriptive terms defined by a {product-title} user or
  the system used to categorize a resource.
Template::
  A template is a copy of a preconfigured virtual machine, designed to
  capture installed software and software configurations, as well as the
  hardware configuration, of the original virtual machine.
Unmanaged Virtual Machine::
  Files discovered on a datastore that do not have a virtual machine
  associated with them in the VMDB. These files may be registered to a
  provider that the {product-title} server does not have
  configuration information on. Possible causes may be that the provider
  has not been discovered or that the provider has been discovered, but
  no security credentials have been provided.
Virtual Machine::
  A software implementation of a system that functions similar to a
  physical machine. Virtual machines utilize the hardware infrastructure
  of a physical host, or a set of physical hosts, to provide a scalable
  and on-demand method of system provisioning.
Virtual Management Database (VMDB)::
  Database used by the {product-title} appliance to store
  information about your resources, users, and anything else required to
  manage your virtual enterprise.
Virtual Thumbnail::
  An icon divided into smaller areas that summarize the properties of a
  resource.
Zones::
  {product-title} Infrastructure can be organized into
  zones to configure failover and to isolate traffic. Zones can be
  created based on your environment. Zones can be based on geographic
  location, network location, or function. When first started, new
  servers are put into the default zone.
