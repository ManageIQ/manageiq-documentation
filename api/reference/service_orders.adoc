== Service Orders

The service orders collection and actions are provided for managing Shopping Carts and their related
service requests.

[source,data]
----
/api/service_orders

Available actions on service_orders instances include:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|=====================
| Action | Description
| create | Creating the Shopping Cart
| clear | Clearing the Shopping Cart
| order | Ordering all service requests in the Shopping Cart
| copy | Copying the Shopping Cart
| delete | Deleting the Shopping Cart
|=====================

Some important points on Shopping Carts:

* There is one and only one shopping cart for the authenticated user
* A shopping cart is an /api/service_orders resource with a state of *cart*
* Shopping carts can be referenced by their resource id or preferably via the alphanumeric **cart** identifier.
* resource id's need to be used for accessing non-cart service_orders states of *wish* list and *ordered*

Items to add to a shopping cart are _service_requests_ that are specified similarly to when
services are ordered from a service template.
