= Viewing a VMware Virtual Machine's Storage Profile

VMware storage profiles allow you to assign policies to datastores. Storage profiles are used to tag virtual machines to ensure they operate in compliance with settings in the datastore.

{product-title} retrieves VMware virtual machine storage profile information in the inventory, and associates the virtual machines and disks with them.

To view a virtual machine's storage profile:

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Virtual Machines].
. Click a VMware virtual machine to open its summary page.
. The VMware *Storage Profile* is listed under *Properties*.

You can assign a storage profile when provisioning a VMware virtual machine in {product-title}, by using the virtual machine as a template to clone. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.5/single/provisioning-virtual-machines-and-hosts/#provisioning-virtual-machines[Provisioning Virtual Machines] in _Provisioning Virtual Machines and Hosts_ for instructions.
