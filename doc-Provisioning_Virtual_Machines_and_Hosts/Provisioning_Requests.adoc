=== Requirements for Provisioning Virtual Machines and Instances
		
CloudForms Management Engine supports the provisioning of VMware ESX hosts/hypervisors. To provision a virtual machine from VMware providers, you must have an appliance with the Automation Engine role enabled.

If you are using a Windows template, the following configuration is required:

* To customize settings that are inside the operating system, Sysprep must be copied to the appropriate directory on your vCenter computer. Usually this location is: +class="directory">C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\VMware\VMware VirtualCenter\sysprep+. Copy the Sysprep tools to the relevant operating system subdirectory. If you are running a standard Win2008 operating system, this step is unnecessary as Sysprep is included as standard.
* The Windows template must have the latest version of VMware tools for its ESX Server. Check the VMware Site for more information. If you are creating a new password for the Administrator account, the Administrators password must be blank on the template. This is a limitation of Microsoft Sysprep.

See the VMware documentation for a complete list of customization requirements.

=== PXE Provisioning

PXE is a boot method that allows you to load files from across a network link. CloudForms Management Engine uses it for files required for provisioning virtual machines. PXE can be used for provisioning for either Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager or VMware.

*Procedure Overview*

. Connect to the +PXE Server+.
. Create a +System Image Type+.
. Associate each +PXE+ image with an image type.
. Create a customization template.

*Requirements for PXE Provisioning*

* DHCP server configured with required PXE implementation
* PXE implementation for Linux virtual machine provisioning
* NFS or SAMBA read and write access to create and modify files on the PXE server
* CloudForms Management Engine Server uses NFS mount to read and write the response files
* HTTP read access to the NFS share location as virtual machines use this URL to access PXE images and Kickstart or Cloud-Init configuration files
* Operating system installation media available to be streamed from PXE server
* Images configured for desired operating systems
* Kickstart or Cloud-Init templates to configure operating systems with desired packages

*Additional Requirements for Provisioning Linux Virtual Machines*

* Linux distribution kernel and ramdisk available over HTTP
* Linux sources available over HTTP
* Sample PXE menu item that boots this kernel

*Additional Requirements for Provisioning Windows Virtual Machines*

* WinPE ISO built with rhev-agent-tools (for RHEV-M environments) and configured to mount shares for Windows source files and Sysprep files and configured to run customization script
* Windows based WIM file with operating system installed and configured with Sysprep
* Sample Sysprep unattend file to be used with the operating system
* Sample PXE menu item that downloads WinPE ISO, mount in memdisk and boot into WinPE environment


=== Connecting to a PXE Server

The following procedure connects to a PXE server and adds its details to CloudForms Management Engine.

. Navigate to +Infrastructure → PXE+.
. Click image:1847.png[](+Configuration+), then image:1848.png[](+Add a New PXE Server+).
. In +Basic Information+, type a +Name+ that will be meaningful in your environment.
image:2316.png[]
. For +Depot Type+, select either +Network File System+ (NFS) or +Samba+. The fields to enter in the dialog depend on the +Depot Type+.
* For NFS, type in the +URI+, +Access URL+, +PXE Directory+, +Windows Images Directory+ and +Customization Directory+. When you provision, CloudForms Management Engine writes a text file to the +PXE Directory+. The file is named after the MAC address of the NIC that is assigned to the virtual machine. It contains where to get the kernel and initrd image. This file is removed after a successful provision. The +Windows Images Directory+ is where the files are located on your NFS for the provisioning of Windows operating systems. The +Customization Directory+ is where your Kickstart and Sysprep files are located.
* If using a +Depot Type+ of +Samba+, you will not need +Access URL+, but you will need a +User ID+, and +Password+, in addition to the items required for NFS.
. For +PXE Image Menus+, type the +filename+ for the PXE Boot menu.
. Click +Add+.
. Select the new PXE server from the tree on the left, and click image:1847.png[](+Configuration+), then image:2003.png[](+Refresh+) to see your existing images.
[NOTE]
============
Next, create PXE Image types to associate with the customization templates and to specify if the image type is for a virtual machine, a host, or both.

=== Customization Templates for Virtual Machine and Instance Provisioning

Add a customization template to provide +Kickstart+, +Cloud-Init+, or +Sysprep+ files for the initial loading of the operating system.

.Cloud-Init Requirements
* When creating a template using Red Hat Virtualization, install the +cloud-init+ package on the source virtual machine. This enables Cloud-Init to source configuration scripts when a virtual machine built on that template boots.
* See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.5/html/Administration_Guide/index.html[Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Administration Guide] for more information on using Cloud-Init in a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.
* See the http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/[Cloud-Init Documentation] web site for example scripts.

.Kickstart Requirements for ISO Provisioning
* Name the +Kickstart+ file +ks.cfg+.
* Set the new virtual machine to power down after provisioning is complete.
* CFME must use the virtual machine payload feature of RHEV to create a floppy disk containing the data from the selected customization template.
* Customize the installer to include the data written to the floppy disk payload.

[example]
.RHEL ISO with the following modifications:
====
* `isolinux.cfg` &ndash; modify default menu item +append+ line to include +ks=cdrom+
* `ks.cfg` &ndash; which must minimally include:
+
----
### Pre Install Scripts
%pre

# Mount the floppy drive
modprobe floppy
mkdir /tmp/floppy
mount /dev/floppy /tmp/floppy
%end

# Include ks.cfg file from the floppy (written by CFME based on selected customization template)
%include /tmp/floppy/ks.cfg
----
====

=== Provisioning Virtual Machines

There are three types of provisioning requests available in CloudForms Management Engine:

. Provision a new virtual machine from a template
. Clone a virtual machine
. Publish a virtual machine to a template

=== Provisioning a Virtual Machine from a Template

You can provision virtual machines through various methods. One method is to provision a virtual machine directly from a template stored on a provider.

[IMPORTANT]
=================
To provision a virtual machine, you must have the "Automation Engine" role enabled.
=================

To Provision a Virtual Machine from a Template:

. Navigate to +Infrastructure → Virtual Machines+.
. Click image:2007.png[](+Lifecycle+), and then image:1848.png[](+Provision VMs+).
. Select a template from the list presented.
. Click +Continue+.
. On the +Request+ tab, enter information about this provisioning request. 
+
image:2326.png[]
+
In +Request Information+, type in at least a +First Name+ and +Last Name+ and an email address. This email is used to send the requester status emails during the provisioning process for items such as auto-approval, quota, provision complete, retirement, request pending approval, and request denied. The other information is optional. If the CloudForms Management Engine server is configured to use LDAP, you can use the +Look Up+ button to populate the other fields based on the email address.
+
[NOTE]
==========
Parameters with a * next to the label are required to submit the provisioning request. To change the required parameters, see Customizing Provisioning Dialogs.
==========

. Click the +Purpose+ tab to select the appropriate tags for the provisioned virtual machines.
. Click the +Catalog+ tab to select the template to provision from. This tab is context sensitive based on provider.
. For templates on VMware providers:
image:2328.png[]
.. For +Provision Type+, select +VMware+ or +PXE+.
... If +VMware+ is selected, select +Linked Clone+ to create a linked clone to the virtual machine instead of a full clone. Since a snapshot is required to create a linked clone, this box is only enabled if a snapshot is present. Select the snapshot you want to use for the linked clone.
... If +PXE+ is selected, select a PXE +Server+ and +Image+ to use for provisioning
.. Under +Count+, select the number of virtual machines to create in this request.
.. Use +Naming+ to specify a virtual machine name and virtual machine description. When provisioning multiple virtual machines, a number will be appended to the virtual machine name.
. For templates on Red Hat providers:
.. Select the +Name+ of a template to use.
.. For +Provision Type+, select either +ISO+, +PXE+, or +Native Clone+. You must select +Native Clone+ in order to use a Cloud-Init template.
... If +Native Clone+ is selected, select +Linked Clone+ to create a linked clone to the virtual machine instead of a full clone. This is equivalent to _Thin Template Provisioning_ in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization. Since a snapshot is required to create a linked clone, this box is only enabled if a snapshot is present. Select the snapshot to use for the linked clone.
... If +ISO+ is selected, select an ISO +Image+ to use for provisioning
... If +PXE+ is selected, select a PXE +Server+ and +Image+ to use for provisioning
.. Under +Count+, select the number of virtual machines you want to create in this request.
.. Use +Naming+ to specify a +VM Name+ and +VM Description+. When provisioning multiple virtual machines, a number will be appended to the +VM Name+.
. Click the +Environment+ tab to decide where you want the new virtual machines to reside.
.. If provisioning from a template on VMware, you can either let CloudForms Management Engine decide for you by checking +Choose Automatically+, or select a specific cluster, resource pool, folder, host, and datastore.
.. If provisioning from a template on Red Hat, you can either let CloudForms Management Engine decide for you by checking +Choose Automatically+, or select a datacenter, cluster, host and datastore.
. Click the +Hardware+ tab to set hardware options.
image:2330.png[]
.. In +VM Hardware+, set the number of CPUs, amount of memory, and disk format: thin, pre-allocated/thick or same as the provisioning template (default).
.. For VMware provisioning, set the +VM Limits+ of CPU and memory the virtual machine can use.
.. For VMware provisioning, set the +VM Reservation+ amount of CPU and memory.
. Click +Network+ to set the vLan adapter. Additional networking settings that are internal to the operating system appear on the +Customize+ tab.
image:2335.png[]
.. In +Network Adapter Information+, select the +vLan+.
. Click +Customize+ to customize the operating system of the new virtual machine. These options vary based on the operating system of the template.
image:2336.png[]
. For Windows provisioning:
.. To use a customer specification from the Provider, click +Specification+. To select an appropriate template, choose from the list in the custom specification area. The values that are honored by CloudForms Management Engine display.
+
[NOTE]
======
Any values in the specification that do not show in the CloudForms Management Engine console's request dialogs are not used by CloudForms Management Engine. For example, for Windows operating systems, if you have any run once values in the specification, they are not used in creating the new virtual machines. Currently, for a Windows operating system, CloudForms Management Engine honors the unattended GUI, identification, workgroup information, user data, windows options, and server license. If more than one network card is specified, only the first is used.
======	
+
image:2337.png[]
+
To modify the specification, select +Override Specification Values+.
.. Select +Sysprep Answer File+, to upload a Sysprep file or use one that exists for a custom specification on the Provider where the template resides. To upload a file, click +Browse+ to find the file, and then upload. To use an answer file in +Customization Specification+, click on the item. The answer file will automatically upload for viewing. You cannot make modifications to it.
. For Linux provisioning:
.. Under +Credentials+, enter a +Root Password+ for the +root+ user to access the instance.
.. Enter a +IP Address Information+ for the instance. Leave as +DHCP+ for automatic IP assignment from the provider.
.. Enter any +DNS+ information for the instance if necessary.
.. Select +Customize Template+ for additional instance configuration. Select from the Kickstart or Cloud-Init customization templates stored on your appliance.
. Click the +Schedule+ tab to select when provisioning begins.
.. In +Schedule Info+, select when to start provisioning. If you select +Schedule+, you will be prompted to enter a date and time. Select +Stateless+ if you do not want the files deleted after the provision completes. A stateless provision does not write to the disk so it requires the PXE files on the next boot.
.. In +Lifespan+, select to power on the virtual machines after they are created, and to set a retirement date. If you select a retirement period, you will be prompted for when you want a retirement warning.
image:2338.png[]
. Click +Submit+.

The provisioning request is sent for approval. For the provisioning to begin, a user with the administrator, approver, or super administrator account role must approve the request. The administrator and super administrator roles can also edit, delete, and deny the requests. You will be able to see all provisioning requests where you are either the requester or the approver.

After submission, the appliance assigns each provision request a +Request ID+. If an error occurs during the approval or provisioning process, use this ID to locate the request in the appliance logs. The Request ID consists of the region associated with the request followed by the request number. As regions define a range of one trillion database IDs, this number can be several digits long.

*Request ID Format*

Request 99 in region 123 results in Request ID 123000000000099.

==== Requirements for Provisioning a Host

CloudForms Management Engine can provision hosts using PXE and Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) technologies. Before you provision your first host, configure the following prerequisites:

* Provisioning requires the +Automation Engine+ server role be enabled. Confirm your server role settings in +Configure → Configuration → Server → Server Control+.
* Make a PXE server accessible to the CloudForms Management Engine server.
* Create a customization template for hosts. This customization template must contain host-specific additions, documented in the Customization Templates for Host Provisioning section.
* Create system image types for the host.
* Associate images with the image types.
* Enable IPMI on provisioning hosts and add them to the CloudForms Management Engine Infrastructure.


===== IPMI Hosts

There are two ways to get the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) Host into the VMDB. You can either use the CloudForms Management Engine's discovery process or add the host using its IP address and credentials.

[NOTE]
======
The default dialogs show all possible parameters for provisioning. To limit the options shown, Customizing Provisioning Dialogs.
======	

==== Provisioning a Host

After setting up the IPMI and PXE environments, you are ready to provision a host. Currently, you can only provision in the cluster where the template is located or you can create a template in each cluster and let a CloudForms Management Engine Automate method automatically switch the selected template in the provision object.

[IMPORTANT]
======
A customization template with host-specific script additions is required. Ensure especially that the customization template contains the post-installation callback to enable discovery in CloudForms Management Engine.
======

. Navigate to +Infrastructure → Hosts+.
. Select a host with IPMI enabled.
. Click image:2007.png[](+Lifecycle+), then image:1848.png[](+Provision Hosts+).
. In +Request Information+, type in at least a +First Name+ and +Last Name+ and an email address. This email is used to send the requester status emails during the provisioning. The other information is optional. If the CloudForms Management Engine server is configured to use LDAP, you can use the +Look Up+ button to populate the other fields based on the email address.
image:2341.png[]
. On the +Purpose+ tab, select the desired tags for the provisioned host.
image:2342.png[]
. On the +Catalog+ tab, select the hosts to provision.
* In the +Host+ area, select the hosts to provision.
* In the +PXE+ area, select the PXE server and image.
. On the +Customize+ tab, you can select customizations for the operating system of the new host. These options vary based on the operating system to be provisioned.
* Use +Credentials+ to type in a root password
* In the +IP Address+ area, select either +Static+ or +DHCP+ and enter any other address information you need. If needed, type in DNS specifications.
* Under +Customize Template+, select a script.
. On the +Schedule+ tab, select when to start the provisioning process.
image:2343.png[]
. In +Schedule Info+, select when to start the provisioning process. If you select +Schedule+, enter a date and time.
. Select +Stateless+ to retain files after the provision completes. A stateless provision does not write to the disk so it requires the PXE files on the next boot.
. Click +Submit+.

The provisioning request is sent for approval. For the provisioning to begin, a user with the admin, approver, or super admin account role must approve the request. The admin and super admin roles can also edit, delete, and deny the requests. You will be able to see all provisioning requests where you are either the requester or the approver.

After submission, the appliance assigns each provision request a +Request ID+. If an error occurs during the approval or provisioning process, use this ID to locate the request in the appliance logs. The Request ID consists of the region associated with the request followed by the request number. As regions define a range of one trillion database IDs, this number can be several digits long.

*Request ID Format*

Request 99 in region 123 results in Request ID 123000000000099.

==== Customizing Provisioning Dialogs

The default set of provisioning dialogs shows all possible options. However, CloudForms Management Engine also provides the ability to customize which tabs and fields are shown. You can decide what fields are required to submit the provisioning request or set default values.

For each type of provisioning, there is a dialog that can be created to adjust what options are presented. While samples are provided containing all possible fields for provisioning, you can remove what fields are shown. However, you cannot add fields or tabs.

Edit the dialogs to:

. Hide or show provisioning tabs.
. Hide or show fields. If you hide an attribute, the default will be used, unless you specify otherwise.
. Set default values for a field.
. Specify if a field is required to submit the request.
. Create custom dialogs for specific users.


===== Adding a Provision Dialog for All Users

. Login to the CloudForms Management Engine console for the CloudForms Management Engine server where you want to change the dialog.
. Navigate to +Automate → Customization+.
. Click the +Provisioning Dialogs+ accordion.
. Click the type of dialog you want to create: +Host Provision+, +VM Provision+ or +VM Migrate+.
. Select one of the default dialogs.
. Click image:1847.png[]+(Configuration)+, and then image:1859.png[]+(Copy this Dialog)+.
. Type a new +Name+ and +Description+ for the dialog.
. In the +Content+ field,
* To remove a tab from display, change its display value to ignore. By choosing ignore, you not only hide the tab, but also skip any fields on that tab that were required. To show the tab, change the display value to show.
* To hide a field, change its display value from +edit+ to +hide+. To display fields of most data types, use +edit+. To display a button, use +show+. To set a default value for a field, use +:default =&gt; defaultvalue+ to the list of parameters for the field. Set the required parameter to either +true+ or +false+ based on your needs. Note that if you set required parameter to +true+, the field must have a value for the provision request to be submitted.
. Click +Add+.

If you are using +Provisioning Profiles+, you can specify a specific file that holds the customizations. To do this, you must create an instance mapping to this file in the CloudForms Management Engine Applications/provisioning/profile/VM provisioning by group class. By default, if you are using provisioning profiles and the group does not have a defined instance, the appropriate default dialog file will be used based on the type of provisioning selected.
	
===== Creating a Custom Provision Dialog

. Navigate to +Automate → Customization+.
. Click on the +Provisioning Dialogs+ accordion.
. Click on the type of dialog you want to create, +Host Provision+, +VM Provision+ or +VM Migrate+.
. Select one of the default dialogs.
. Click image:1847.png[](+Configuration+), and then image:1859.png[](+Copy this Dialog+).
. Rename the dialog as shown in the examples below.
[width="100%",cols="50%,50%a",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Type of Provision|Dialog Name
|Provision Virtual Machine from a template|miq\_provision_dialogs_groupname_template Example: miq_provision_dialogs_ EvmGroup-user_self_service _template
|Clone a Virtual Machine|miq\_provision_dialogs_groupname_clone_to_vm Example: miq_provision_dialogs_ EvmGroup-user_self_service _clone_to_vm
|Publish a Virtual Machine to a template|miq\_provision_dialogs_groupname_clone_to_template Example: miq_provision_dialogs_ EvmGroup-user_self_service _clone_to_template
|=======================================================================
. Make any changes you need.
. In the +Content+ field,
* To remove a tab from display, change its display value to ignore. By choosing ignore, you not only hide the tab, but also skip any fields on that tab that were required. To show the tab, change the display value to show.
* To hide a field, change its display value from +edit+ to +hide+. To ensure the field does not get turned back on by a workflow model, use +:display_override =&gt; :hide+. To display fields of most data types, use +edit+. To display a button, use +show+. To set a default value for a field, use +:default =&gt; defaultvalue+ to the list of parameters for the field. Set the required parameter to either +true+ or +false+ based on your needs. Note that if you set required to true, the field must have a value for the provision request to be submitted.
. Click +Add+.

Enter the name of the new dialog into the dialog name field in the appropriate CloudForms Management Engine Applications/provisioning/profile instance. This dialog can now be referred to in an instance in the Provisioning Profiles class so that it can be used for groups of users.

==== Provisioning Profiles

Provisioning profiles can be used to customize the dialogs and the state machine (steps used to provision the machine). Profiles can be created for LDAP or CloudForms Management Engine groups. To use provisioning profiles:

* Create a +Provisioning Profile+ instance for the LDAP or CloudForms Management Engine group. If no instance exists, then default settings will be used.
* If customizing dialogs, create a custom dialog file, and specify the name of that file in the provisioning profile instance. If customizing the states for provisioning, create a state instance and set the name of the state instance in the provisioning profile instance.

The diagram below shows where provisioning profiles are called during the entire provisioning process.
image:2344.png[]

===== Creating a Provisioning Profile Instance

. Navigate to +Automate → Explorer+.
. Using the tree located in the accordion, click +DOMAIN → Cloud → VM → Provisioning → Profile+.
+
[NOTE]
======
+DOMAIN+ must be a user-defined Domain and not the locked ManageIQ Domain. If necessary, you can copy the class from the ManageIQ domain into a custom domain.

This example uses the +Cloud+ Namespace, but can also use the +Infrastructure+ namespace.
======
+
. Click image:1847.png[](+Configuration+), image:2345.png[](+Add a New Instance+).
. Make the name of the tag identical to the name of the LDAP or CloudForms Management Engine group you are creating the instance for, replacing spaces in the group name with underscores. For example, change +Red Hat CloudForms-test group+ to +Red Hat CloudForms-test_group+.
image:6278.png[]
. In the dialog name field, enter the name of the customized dialog file. This file must reside on the CloudForms Management Engine Appliance in the +/var/www/miq/vmdb/db/fixtures+ directory. Red Hat recommends naming the file in the format +miq_provision_dialogs-groupname.rb+ and copying this file to all CloudForms Management Engine appliances. For example, in the image above the filename is +miq_provision_dialogs-Red Hat CloudForms-test.rb+. For instructions on creating a custom dialog file, see Customizing Provisioning Dialogs.
+
[NOTE]
======
Be sure that the custom dialog file exists. If it does not, an error will appear when the user clicks on the +Provisioning+ button in the CloudForms Management Engine console.
======
+
. Click +Add+.


===== Setting Provisioning Scope Tags

Some non-default placement methods, for example the +redhat_best_placement_with_scope+ or +vmware_best_fit_with_scope+ methods, may require you to set +Provisioning Scope+ tags for a host and a datastore.

To enable these resources for all groups, set the scope to +All+. To limit access to a select group, create a tag in the +Provisioning Scope+ category with the exact name of the user group and set this tag on the desired resources. See Tags in General Configuration for information on creating tags.

To set the scope for a host:

. Navigate to +Infrastructure → Hosts+.
. Select the host to set the provisioning scope for.
. Click image:1941.png[](+Policy+), and then image:2158.png[](+Edit Tags+).
. From the +Select a customer tag to assign+ drop down, select +Provisioning Scope+ and then a value for the tag from the next drop down menu.
. Click +Save+.

To set the scope for a datastore:

. Navigate to +Infrastructure → Datastores+.
. Select the datastore to set the provisioning scope for.
. Click image:1941.png[](+Policy+), and then image:2158.png[](+Edit Tags+).
. From the +Select a customer tag to assign+ drop down, select +Provisioning Scope+ and then a value for the tag from the next drop down menu.
. Click +Save+.
