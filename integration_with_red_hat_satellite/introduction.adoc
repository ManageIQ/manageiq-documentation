== Introduction

Satellite 6 is a subscription and system management tool that provides a way to provision hosts (both virtual and bare metal) and configure them using a set of Puppet modules. {product-title} provides functionality to integrate with a Satellite 6 server and take advantage of its features. This includes:

* Monitoring the inventory of your Satellite 6 server, including independent hosts and hosts provisioned using hostgroups.
* Reprovisioning existing bare mental systems hosts to new host groups.
* Applying {product-title} Management Engine policy tags to hosts.

This guide provides a step-by-step workflow on how to integrate {product-title} 4.1 and Satellite 6 together.
