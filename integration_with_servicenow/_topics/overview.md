## Overview

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} integration with ServiceNow enables authentication with
an existing ServiceNow database and **add/amend** items in the
ServiceNow database during state machine processing, such as the virtual
machine provisioning state machine. Note that information in this guide
assumes you have credentials and access to a ServiceNow database
instance.

The following new namespace and class delivers support for the
management of **ServiceNow Configuration Management Database** (CMDB)
records using **ServiceNowâ€™s RESTful** web service.
