== The My Services Tab

Use the +My Services+ tab to filter and view details of the services. Optionally, you can set a string in the filter field at the top to filter services by Service Name, Number of VMs, or Owner.
You can also sort the services in ascending or descending order by Name, Retirement Date, Owner, or Creation Date. Select a service from the results to view details.

Selecting the service item will return the +Service Properties+ page, detailing the aggregate information for the service virtual machines, the service parameters from the service dialog, and the individual virtual machines in the service.

To retire or remove the service:

* Click +Retire+ to remove it on a schedule, and enter the date to retire it.
* Click +Remove+ to retire the service immediately.
