# OpenShift Virtualization (KubeVirt) Providers

OpenShift Virtualization (KubeVirt) is a virtualization layer which allows Virtual Machines to be managed along side containers using standard Kubernetes utilities.

In order to add a OpenShift Virtualization (KubeVirt) provider to ManageIQ you must first have a Kubernetes or OpenShift provider and then add a Virtualization endpoint.

Once added you should see VMs, Hosts, Clusters, and Storages like any other Infrastructure provider.
