=== Invoking Automate using a Custom Button

One of the ways to invoke an Automate model is to map an instance from the `/System/Process/Request` class to a custom button. Before creating the button, you need to have an instance in the `/System/Process/Request` class to map to it and a button group to
assign it to.

Create buttons for a cluster, host, datastore, provider, virtual
machines or cloud instances. When the button is clicked, the model will be invoked for the selected item. For each of these, you can have up to 15 buttons.
