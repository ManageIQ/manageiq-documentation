= Editing a Containers Provider

Edit information about a provider such as the name, hostname, IP address or port, and credentials as required. If you have just upgraded your {product-title_short} environment from an older version, edit the provider to specify the authentication method the provider uses to connect to {product-title}.


. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Providers].
. Click the containers provider to edit.
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), and then  image:1851.png[Edit Selected Containers Provider] (*Edit Selected Containers Provider*).
. Edit the *Name* if required.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Type* value is unchangeable.
====
+
. Under *Endpoints* in the *Default* tab, edit the following as required: 
.. Select a *Security Protocol* method to specify how to authenticate the provider:
* *SSL*: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required for this option.
* *SSL trusting custom CA*: Authenticate the provider with a self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your provider’s CA certificate to the *Trusted CA Certificates* box in PEM format.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can obtain your OpenShift Container Platform provider's CA certificate for all endpoints (default, metrics, alerts) from `/etc/origin/master/ca.crt`. Paste the output (a block of text starting with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`) into the *Trusted CA Certificates* field.
====
+
* *SSL without validation*: Authenticate the provider insecurely (not recommended).
.. Enter the *Hostname* (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) of the provider.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The *Hostname* must use a unique fully qualified domain name.
====
+
.. Enter the *API Port* of the provider. The default port is `8443`.
.. Enter a token for your provider in the *Token* box.
+
[NOTE]
====
To obtain a token for your provider, run the `oc get secret` command on your provider; see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6-beta/html-single/managing_providers/#Obtaining_OpenShift_Container_Platform_Management_Token[Obtaining an OpenShift Container Platform Management Token].

For example:

# oc get secret --namespace management-infra management-admin-token-8ixxs --template='{{index .data "ca.crt"}}' | base64 --decode
====

.. Click *Validate* to confirm that {product-title} can connect to the OpenShift Container Platform provider.
. Under *Endpoints* in the *Metrics* tab, configure the following for gathering capacity and utilization metrics for Hawkular or Prometheus based on the selection:
.. Select a *Security Protocol* method to specify how to authenticate the provider:
* *SSL*: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required for this option.
* *SSL trusting custom CA*: Authenticate the provider with a self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your provider’s CA certificate to the *Trusted CA Certificates* box in PEM format.
* *SSL without validation*: Authenticate the provider insecurely using SSL. (Not recommended)
.. Enter the *Hostname* (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) of the provider.
.. Enter the *API Port* if your provider uses a non-standard port for access. The default port is `443`.
.. Click *Validate* to confirm that {product-title} can connect to the endpoint.
. Under *Endpoints* in the *Alerts* tab, configure the following for Prometheus alerting from the cluster.
* *SSL*: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required for this option.
