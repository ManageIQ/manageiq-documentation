=== REST API Authentication

There are two methods of authentication for the REST API, these are:

* Basic Authentication
* Token based Authentication

With Basic Authentication, the user and password credentials are passed
in with each HTTP request as follows:

[[request-using-basic-authentication]]
==== Request using Basic Authentication

[source,sh]
----
$ curl --user username:password
        -i -X GET -H "Accept: application/json"
        http://localhost:3000/api/services/1013
----

However, for multiple REST API calls to the Appliance, it is recommended
to use the Token based Authentication. In this approach, the client
requests a token for the username/password credentials specified. Then
the token is used in lieu of the username/password for each subsequent
API call.

Authentication tokens:

* Are associated with the user credentials
* Provide the necessary identify for RBAC in subsequent REST API calls
* Expire after a certain amount of time with no REST API activity - 10 minutes by default.

==== Requesting an authentication token

[[request]]
Request:

[source,sh]
----
$ curl --user username:password
        -i X GET -H "Accept: application/json"
        http://localhost:3000/api/auth
----

[[response]]
Response for the Authentication Token Request:

[source,data]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "auth_token": "93d98fd44cc5a401ff385ba87b21fd13",
  "token_ttl": 600,
  "expires_on": "2015-11-02T21:50:16Z"
}

[[request-using-token-based-authentication]]
==== Request using Token based authentication

[source,sh]
----
$ curl -i -X GET -H "Accept: application/json"
       -H "X-Auth-Token: 93d98fd44cc5a401ff385ba87b21fd13"
       http://localhost:3000/api/services/1013

[[failed-response-due-to-invalid-token]]
Failed response due to invalid token

[source,data]
----
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Application"
...
----

When a request fails due to an invalid token, the client would then need
to re-authenticate with the user credentials to obtain a new
Authentication Token.


[[requesting-an-authentication-token-for-ui-client]]
==== Requesting an authentication token for a UI client

While the default duration for a REST API token is 10 minutes, it is not sufficient for UI type clients
where the token is needed for sessions that time-out much later.

For such environments, it is possible to request a REST API token to leverage the administrative UI
session timeout.  This is requested with the *requester_type* parameter witih the value *ui* as follows:


[[request]]
Request:

[source,sh]
----
$ curl --user username:password
        -i X GET -H "Accept: application/json"
        http://localhost:3000/api/auth?requester_type=ui
----

Response for the Authentication Token Request:

----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "auth_token": "8789bcd6562beacbaf9f77927c2825e2",
  "token_ttl": 3600,
