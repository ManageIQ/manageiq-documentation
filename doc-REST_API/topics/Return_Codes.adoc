==== Return Codes

.Success


* *200 OK* - The request has succeeded without errors, this code should be returned for example when retrieving a collection or a single resource. 
* *201 Created* - The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a *new resource being created*.
  The resource is available before this status code is returned.
  The response includes the HTTP body of the newly created resource. 
* *202 Accepted* - The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
  Like, resource is not fully available yet.
  This status code is usually returned when the resource creation happens asynchronously.
  In this case the HTTP response includes a pointer to *monitor* or a *job* where the client can query to get the current status of the request and the estimate on when the request will be actually fulfilled. 
* *204 No Content* - The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an entity-body, and might want to return updated meta information.
  This HTTP response is commonly used for the `DELETE` requests, as the resource that was deleted does not exists anymore. 		

.Client Errors


* *400 Bad Request* - The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.
  The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.
  In REST API this status code should be returned to client when the client use the wrong combination of attributes, like expanding the non-existing collection, or using the pagination parameter incorrectly.
  Another use-case could be creating or performing actions on the resource, when the wrong JSON serialization of the resource or action is used. 
* *401 Unauthorized* - The request requires user authentication.
  The response MUST include a *Authenticate* header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.
  If the request include *Authenticate* header, then this HTTP status code might indicate that the current user is *not authorized* to perform given action or to access given resource. 
* *403 Forbidden* - The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.
  Authorization will not help in this case.
  This HTTP status code might indicate that the action performed is not supported for this resource or collection. 
* *404 Not Found* - In this case, the server has not found anything that matches with the URL. 
* *415 Unsupported Media Type* - The server is refusing to service the request because the entity of the request is in a format not supported by the requested resource for the requested method.
  This error must be returned, when the client is explicitly asking for format other than JSON (application/json). 		

.Server Errors


* *500 Internal Server Error* - The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.
  This error code must be used when an exception is raised in the application and the exception has nothing to do with the client request.
