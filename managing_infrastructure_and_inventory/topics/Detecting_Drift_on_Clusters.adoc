= Detecting Drift on Clusters

Over time, a cluster's configuration might change.
Drift is the comparison of a cluster to itself at different points in time.
The cluster requires analysis at least twice to collect information.
Detecting drift provides users with the following benefits:

* See the difference between the last known state of a cluster and its current state
* Review the configuration changes that happen to a particular cluster between multiple points in time.
* Capture the configuration drifts for a single cluster across a time period.

. Navigate to menu:Infrastructure[Clusters].
. Click on the cluster to view drift.
. Click *Relationships* in the Cluster Accordion.
. Click *Drift History*.
. Check the analyses to compare.
. Click  image:images/1946.png[] (*Drift Analysis*) at the top of the screen.
  The results are displayed.
. Check the *Comparison* sections on the left to view in your comparison.
. Click the plus sign next to the section name to expand it.
+
* An item displayed on red text shows a change from the base analysis.
  An item displayed in black text shows no change from the base analysis.
* A  image:images/2177.png[] (*Changed from previous*) shows there has been a change since the last analysis.
* A  image:images/2150.png[] (*Same as previous*) means there has been no change since the last analysis.
* Click  image:images/1861.png[] (*Remove from drift*) at the bottom of a column to remove a specific analysis.
  The drift is then recalculated and the new results display.

. Click  image:images/2023.png[] (*Expanded View*) to see the expanded view.
  Click  image:images/2024.png[] (*Compressed View*)] to compress the information.
. Click the minus sign next to the section name to collapse it.
. To limit the type of views, there are three buttons in the Taskbar.
+
* Click  image:images/2178.png[] (*All attributes*) to see all attributes of the sections selected.
* Click  image:images/2204.png[] (*Attributes with different values*) to see only the attributes different across drifts.
* Click  image:images/2148.png[] (*Attributes with the same values*) to see only the attributes the same across drifts.


The drift displays for your cluster.
