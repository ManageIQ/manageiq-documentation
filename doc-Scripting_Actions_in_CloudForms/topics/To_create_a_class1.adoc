=== Creating a Class

. Navigate to `Automate` -> `Explorer`, navigate to the namespace you want to add a class to.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (`Configuration`), then
image:../images/2365.png[image] (`Add a new Class`).

. Type in a unique `Name` and `Description`.

. If you want to use the schema from a class that has already been
created, select it from the `Inherits From` dropdown. If the class that
the new class inherits from changes, the new class will also change.

. Click `Add`.

The new class is created and you can create a schema, add instances and methods.

[NOTE]
======
For each class, create a schema if you did not choose to inherit from an
existing class. The schema can include attributes, methods, assertions,
and relationships.
