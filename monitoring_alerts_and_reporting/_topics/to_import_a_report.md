### Importing a Report

Reports are stored in the VMDB; however, you can share customized
reports among VMDBs. To do this use the export and import feature of
reports.

1.  Navigate to **Overview > Reports**.

2.  Select **Custom Reports** from the **Import/Export** accordion.

3.  In the **Import** area, click **Browse** to select an import file.

4.  To overwrite an existing report with the same menu name, select
    **Overwrite existing reports**.

5.  Click **Upload** to import the report to the **Company-Custom**
    folder.
