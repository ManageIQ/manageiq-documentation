[[Migrating_the_infrastructure]]
= Migrating the infrastructure

Migrating the infrastructure involves the following key tasks:

* Creating an xref:Creating_an_Infrastructure_Mapping[infrastructure mapping] to map the clusters, datastores, and networks of your source environment to your target environment

* Creating and running a xref:Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[migration plan]
+
Optionally, you can xref:Canceling_a_migration_plan[cancel] a migration plan that is in progress and retry the migration in the future.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, IMS supports only cold migration. Virtual machines are powered off gracefully as part of the migration process.
