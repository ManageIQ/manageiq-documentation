== Use Cases

The following examples show how ServiceNow can be integrated with automation workflows.

=== Provisioning a Virtual Machine from a Template

The Cloud and Infrastructure *Provision VM from Template* State Machines contain *RegisterCMDB* and *ActivateCMDB* states.

To create a new ServiceNow record during virtual machine provisioning, amend the *ActiveCMDB* state to call the `create` method, for example:
-------
/Integration/ServiceNow/CMDB/create
-------

=== Virtual Machine Retirement

The Cloud and Infrastructure default *Retirement* State Machines contain *DeactivateCMDB* and *RemoveFromCMDB* states.

To update a virtual machine's ServiceNow record during virtual machine retirement, amend the *DeactivateCMDB* state to call the `update_patch` method, for example:
-------
Integration/ServiceNow/CMDB/update_patch?description=VM%20${/#vm.guid}%20retired%20from%20CloudForms
-------

To delete a virtual machine's ServiceNow record during virtual machine retirement, amend the *RemoveFromCMDB* state to call the `delete` method, for example:
-------
/Integration/ServiceNow/CMDB/delete
-------

=== Virtual Machine Reconfiguration (VMware Only)

Create a new *System Event* instance to update the ServiceNow record after a virtual machine reconfiguration request has been approved and completed.

Create a new */System/Event/ReconfigVM_Task_Complete* instance with a relationship value:
-------
/Integration/ServiceNow/CMDB/update_patch
