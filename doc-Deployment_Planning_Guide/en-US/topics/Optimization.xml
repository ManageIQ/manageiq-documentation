		<para>
			For reporting of daily optimization data, incomplete days (days with less than 24 hourly data points from midnight to midnight) that are at the beginning or end of the requested interval are excluded. Days with less than 24 hourly data points would be inaccurate and including them would skew trend lines. Therefore, the optimize page requires at least two full days of daily data because all the charted values are derived from trend calculations and that requires at least two data points
