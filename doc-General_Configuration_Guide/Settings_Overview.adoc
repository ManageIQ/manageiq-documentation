== Settings Overview

To view or modify global settings for your appliance, hover over the +Configure+ menu and click the sub-tab for the setting to modify.
The availability of each sub-tab depends on the role assigned to your user account. For more information on roles, see section +Account Roles and Descriptions+.

The following is a list of the sub-tabs available from the +Configure+ menu:

* +My Settings+ is available to all CloudForms Management Engine users. Its settings control the visual aspects of the console, time profiles, and tags used by the individual user.
* +Configuration+ is used to specify enterprise, region, zone, and server settings for the CloudForms Management Engine infrastructure. Diagnostics including logs and process status is also shown here.
* +About+ provides session information and links to CloudForms Management Engine documentation as well as the Red Hat Customer Portal.
