=== About Catalogs and Services

Through the use of catalogs, {product-title} provides support for multi-tier service provisioning to deploy layered workloads across hybrid environments. You can create customized dialogs that will give consumers of the services the ability to input just a few parameters and provision the entire service.

[[terminology]]
=== Terminology

*Terminology*

*Catalog Bundle*:: A grouping of Templates.
*Catalog Item*:: A single Template or a group of Templates (catalog bundle).
*Dialog Tabs*:: Part of a Service Dialog.
*Element*:: An item on a tab in a Dialog. It can be a Button, Check Box, Drop Down List, Radio Button, Tag Control, Text Area Box, or a Text Box.
*Provisioning Dialogs*:: Dialogs created for Host Provisioning, VM Migration, or VM Provisioning. The dialog name must be added to the appropriate provision instance to be processed.
*Service Catalog*:: A catalog item or Catalog bundle that is available for provisioning.
*Service Dialogs*:: Made up of fully customizable tabs, items, and values for use with Service provisioning.
*Template*:: A template is a copy of a preconfigured virtual machine, designed to capture installed software and software configurations, as well as the hardware configuration, of the original virtual machine.

[[catalogs]]
=== Catalogs

Catalogs are used to create groups of virtual machines or instances for provisioning. For example, a complete package of a database server, desktop with specialized software already on it, and a firewall. You will need to complete the following steps to create and provision a service catalog.

. Create *Catalog Items* for each virtual machine or instance that will be part of the service.
. Create a *Service* dialog. For example, create a dropdown with three options small, medium, and large.
. Create a method for the Service Dialog. This method defines what each of the options means to each of the individual virtual machines or cloud instances for the service. This method is called from a service provisioning instance in the Automate model.
. Create an instance in the `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template` class that calls the method.
+
[NOTE]
====
DOMAIN must be a user-defined Domain and not the locked ManageIQ Domain. If necessary, you can copy the class from the ManageIQ domain into a custom domain.
====
+
. Associate method with Automate instance.
. Create a *Catalog Bundle*, adding each of the catalog items to it. Select the *Service Dialog* you created. Use the instance created in the `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template` class as the *Entry Point*. Check *Display in Catalog* box.
. Provision a service.

[[service-dialogs]]
==== Service Dialogs

When provisioning a service, input will be needed from the requester. *Service Dialogs* are used to take input from the user. This input is connected to a method in the *Automate* model that defines how the users input is translated into the provision request. Before creating a *Service Dialog*, be sure to plan what items you need the user to input.

===== Importing Service Dialogs

You can share service dialogs between appliances using the export and import features.

. Navigate to menu:Automate[Customization].
. In the *Import/Export* accordion, click *Service Dialog Import/Export*.
. In the *Import* area, click *Browse* to select an import file.
. Click *Upload*.

[[exporting-service-dialogs]]
===== Exporting Service Dialogs

You can share service dialogs between appliances using the export and import features.

. Click *Export*.

[[methods]]
==== Methods

[[creating-a-method-to-associate-with-the-dialog]]
===== Creating a Method to Associate with the Dialog

You will need to create a method that connects the values in the dialog with the provisioning request. The method should be created in the `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template` class of the *Automate* model.

[NOTE]
====
*DOMAIN* must be a user-defined Domain and not the locked ManageIQ Domain. If necessary, you can copy the class from the ManageIQ domain into a custom domain.
====

A method is provided below that was created for the following scenario:

* You want to provision a three-tiered Service that contains catalog items of web, app and DB. Each of these virtual machines (or cloud instances) has been tagged under the *Service* category with the appropriate value. Then, added as a catalog item and combined into a catalog bundle.
* The *Service Dialog* captures the selection of small, medium or large application in a dropdown called *service_type*. When referring to a value captured in an element in a dialog, the name of the element should be prefixed with *dialog_*. For example, *service_type* becomes *dialog_service_type* when used in the method.
* The method will set the memory sizes for each of the catalog items based on the *service_type* selection.

. Select the appropriate dialog name.
. Select the path to the appropriate *ServiceProvision* instance.
. Click on the *Resources* tab, then select the catalog items you want added to the bundle from the *Add a Resource* dropdown.
. Click *Add*.

A catalog bundle is created and visible in the *Service Catalog* accordion.

[NOTE]
====
You should also create and specify an Entry Point in the `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/Methods/CatalogBundle` class for each catalog item that is part of a bundle. If you do not, then the pre and post provision processing will occur for each item in the bundle in addition to processing for the *Catalog Bundle*. To set the entry point, go into each *Catalog Item* and check *Display in Catalog*. Then, you will see the *Entry Point* field.
