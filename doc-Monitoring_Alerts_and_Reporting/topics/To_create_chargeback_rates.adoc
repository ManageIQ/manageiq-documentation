=== Creating Chargeback Rates

{product-title} allows you to create your own set of computing and storage costs to use for billing.

Chargeback rates can be configured at a single rate or in tiers, where one rate is assigned to one usage range, and another rate is assigned to a different usage range. You can also assign fixed and variable rates per tier if desired.

There are three methods to create a chargeback rate: editing or copying an existing rate, or creating a new rate. 

==== Editing a Chargeback Rate

. Navigate to menu:Overview[Chargeback].
. Click the *Rates* accordion and select an existing rate from under *Compute* or *Storage*. 
. Click image:1847.png[] *(Configuration)* and  image:1851.png[] *(Edit this Chargeback Rate)*. 
. Edit the rate as desired.
. Click *Save* at the bottom of the screen to save the chargeback rate.
    
    
==== Copying a Chargeback Rate

. Navigate to menu:Overview[Chargeback].
. Click the *Rates* accordion and select an existing rate from under *Compute* or *Storage*.  
. Click image:1847.png[] *(Configuration)* and  image:1859.png[] *(Copy this Chargeback Rate)*. 
. Edit the rate as desired.
. Click *Add* at the bottom of the screen to save the chargeback rate.

==== Adding a Chargeback Rate

The following example shows a scenario to create a new chargeback rate for allocated CPU usage in Euro per week measured by the following tiers, calculating both fixed and variable costs:

.Example: Creating a tiered chargeback rate
[example]

* Tier 1: 0-2 CPU = 1 Euro fixed + 0.5 Euro variable
* Tier 2: 2-4 CPU = 0.8 Euro fixed + 0.4 Euro variable
* Tier 3: 4 CPU and above = 0.6 Euro fixed + 0.2 Euro variable

To configure this rate:

. Navigate to menu:Overview[Chargeback].
. Click the *Rates* accordion and select *Compute* to create a CPU chargeback rate.
.. Click  image:1847.png[] *(Configuration)* and  image:1862.png[] *(Add a new Chargeback Rate)*.
. Type in a *Description* for the chargeback rate.
. Select *Euro* for currency.
. In *Rate Details*, select the time, and fill in the range and rates for each tier. Alternatively, a single chargeback rate can be configured by using only one tier. For this example, in *Allocated CPU Count*, configure:
.. For tier 1, set:
... In *Per Time*, select *Hourly*.
... In *Range*, specify the CPU range: *Start* remains as `0.0` and *Finish* is `2`.
... In *Rate*, specify `1` for the *Fixed* rate, and `0.5` for the *Variable* rate.
... Click *Add* under *Actions* to create a new, blank *Allocated CPU Count* line for tier 2.
.. For tier 2, set:
... In the new line in *Range*, specify the CPU range: *Start* is `2` and *Finish* is `4`.
... In *Rate*, specify `0.8` for the *Fixed* rate, and `0.4` for the *Variable* rate.
... Click *Add* under *Actions* to create another new, blank *Allocated CPU Count* line for tier 3.
.. For tier 3, set:
... In the new line in *Range*, specify the CPU range: *Start* is `4` and leave *Finish* as `Infinity`.
... In *Rate*, specify `0.6` for the *Fixed* rate, and `0.2` for *Variable*.

The rate can now be assigned.
