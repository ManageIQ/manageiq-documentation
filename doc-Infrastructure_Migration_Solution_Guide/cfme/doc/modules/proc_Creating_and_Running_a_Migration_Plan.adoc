= Creating and running a migration plan

.Prerequisites

* [[CSV_file]]Create a CSV file listing the source virtual machines if you are migrating a large number of virtual machines or if you are xref:Remigrating_Virtual_Machines[remigrating previously migrated virtual machines].
+
The CSV file contains the virtual machine names (mandatory) and providers (optional, to differentiate virtual machines with identical names) in the following format:
+
[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
Name, Provider
_vm01_, _vSphere3_
_vm02_, _vSphere3_
_vm03_, _vSphere3_
...
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are migrating a small number of virtual machines, you do not need to create a CSV file. The migration plan can discover and display a list from which you manually select the virtual machines to migrate.
====

.Procedure

. Click menu:Compute[Migration > Overview].

. Click *Create Migration Plan*.

. Select the infrastructure mapping from the drop-down list.
+
If you select an OpenStack Platform infrastructure mapping, the *Migration Plan Wizard* displays an additional step, *Instance Properties*.

. Enter the name of your migration plan.

. Discover the virtual machines:

* If you are migrating a small number of virtual machines, select *Choose from a list of VMs discovered in the selected infrastructure mapping* and click *Next*.
+

* If you are importing a CSV file:

.. (Optional) You can validate your infrastructure mapping. Select *Choose from a list of VMs discovered in the selected infrastructure mapping* and click *Next*. If your virtual machines appear in the list, the infrastructure mapping is correct. Click *Back*.
.. Select *Import a CSV file with a list of VMs to be migrated* and click *Next*.
.. Click *Import*, browse to the CSV file, and click *Open*.

. Select the virtual machines to migrate and click *Next*.
+
OpenStack Platform only:
+
.. In *Instance Properties*, click the pencil icon to edit the network or flavor of each selected virtual machine. If a flavor is too small for the source virtual machine, it is marked with an asterisk (`*`).
.. Click *Next*.

. The *Advanced Options* screen is displayed.

+
(Optional) You can select xref:Automating_pre_and_post_migration_tasks_with_ansible[Ansible playbook services] to run on the virtual machines in the migration plan before or after the migration. For example, the xref:Ims_rhel_pre-migration_ansible_playbook_example[RHEL pre-migration playbook] performs several tasks to configure a target RHEL virtual machine. You must create the xref:Creating_an_Ansible_service_catalog_item[Ansible environment and service catalog item] before the migration plan.
+
Click *Next*.

. Select *Save migration plan to run later* or *Start Migration Immediately* and click *Create*.
+
* If you selected *Save migration plan to run later*, the migration plan is saved in *Migration Plans Not Started*.
+
To schedule the migration plan, click the *Schedule* button, select a date and time, and click *Schedule*. The plan's status is *Migration Scheduled* with the date and time.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you wish to run a scheduled plan immediately, click *Migrate*.

To edit or delete a schedule or plan, click the *More Actions* icon.
====

* If you selected *Start Migration Immediately*, the migration plan runs immediately.
+
The migration plan may take some time to complete. The migration plan displays progress bars showing the amount of data being transferred, the number of virtual machines being migrated, and the elapsed time.
+
To view the migration progress of individual virtual machines, click *Migration Plans in Progress* and click the migration plan name to display the migration plan details.
+
[NOTE]
====
The counter displaying the migration plan progress in menu:Compute[Migration > Overview] may be a few seconds ahead of the counter that appears in the migration plan details. This is because the migration plan overview counter displays the total time to run the migration plan, while the migration plan details counter displays the time to migrate the virtual machines.
====

. When the migration plan has finished, check the status of the migration plan under *Completed Migrations*. The completed migration plan shows successfully migrated virtual machines. If error messages appear, see xref:Troubleshooting[].

[[Remigrating_Virtual_Machines]]
.Remigrating virtual machines

If your migration goals change, you can remigrate previously migrated virtual machines:

. Delete the target virtual machines corresponding to the source virtual machines that you are remigrating.
. Delete the disks that were created in the target datastore during the earlier migration to free up space.
. Create a xref:CSV_file[CSV file] to import the source virtual machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
The source virtual machines cannot be discovered automatically by the migration plan because they are marked in CloudForms as `migrated`.
====

. Create and run a new migration plan.
