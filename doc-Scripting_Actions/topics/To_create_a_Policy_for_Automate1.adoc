You can now assign this policy to a *Policy Profile*. Then, assign the policy profile to the virtual machines. Every time this event happens on the virtual machine the appropriate Automate Model will be initiated.

[NOTE]
====
If you want the policy to initiate an Automate Model from the
`/System/Process/Request` class, then you can create your own custom
action. Be sure to have an instance in the `/System/Process/Request`
class for it to map to.
