== Enabling {product-title_short} User Interface Access

To access the {product-title} virtual appliance user interface, you need to enable access over ports `80` and `443` to the virtual machine. You can do this using the CLI or from within the Azure portal.

* To enable a port using the CLI, enter `az vm open-port --port <port-number> --resource-group <resource-group> --name <vm-name>`.
* To enable a port using the Microsoft Azure portal, open the properties for the resource group where the appliance is located, click on *Network Security Group*, and add HTTP and HTTPS access.
