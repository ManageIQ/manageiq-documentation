The Red Hat Infrastructure Migration Solution enables you to migrate virtual machines from VMware{nbsp}6.0, or later, to Red Hat Virtualization or Red Hat OpenStack Platform, using Red Hat CloudForms.

Red Hat Virtualization 4.3::
Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) provides a virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You can manage your virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.3/[RHV] documentation for more information.

Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 or later::
Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) provides a scalable, fault-tolerant, private or public cloud based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform[RHOSP] documentation for more information.

Red Hat CloudForms 5.0::
Red Hat CloudForms is the environment in which you perform the migration. CloudForms is a unified set of management tools for use across virtualized, private cloud, and public cloud platforms. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/5.0[CloudForms] documentation for more information.

= Migrating from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization

This guide describes how to plan your migration, to prepare the VMware and Red Hat Virtualization environments, and to migrate your VMware virtual machines.

[id="Preparing_the_vmware_environment_{context}"]
=== Preparing the VMware environment

You can prepare the VMware network and virtual machines for migration.

If you are performing more than ten concurrent migrations from a single VMware hypervisor, you must configure the hypervisor.

[id='Deploying_conversion_hosts-{context}']
==== Deploying the Red Hat Virtualization conversion hosts

You can configure the Red Hat Virtualization conversion hosts to use the VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) in the CloudForms user interface. VDDK converts the VMware disks.

[id='Migrating_virtual_machines_{context}']
== Migrating the virtual machines

You can create an infrastructure mapping and create and run a migration plan in the CloudForms user interface.

Optionally, you can xref:Changing_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations_{context}[change the maximum number of concurrent migrations for conversion hosts or providers] to control the migration process.

=== Migration prerequisites

Check your migration for the following conditions, which have prerequisites:

* If you are migrating previously migrated virtual machines, you must xref:Creating_a_csv_file_to_add_virtual_machines_to_the_migration_plan_{context}[add previously migrated machines to the migration plan with a CSV file]. A CSV file is also recommended for large migrations.

* If you are using Ansible playbooks for premigration/postmigration tasks, you must xref:Adding_ansible_playbooks_to_cloudforms_{context}[create an Ansible repository and add credentials and playbooks to CloudForms].

* If you are migrating virtual machines running RHEL or other Linux operating system, you must xref:Creating_a_rhel_premigration_playbook_{context}[create a RHEL premigration playbook] to preserve IP addresses. You will select this playbook when you create a migration plan.

== Configuring the Red Hat Virtualization environment for SSH transformation

You can configure your Red Hat Virtualization environment for SSH transformation if you cannot use VDDK.

[NOTE]
====
The default transformation method, VDDK, is much faster than SSH.

This configuration involves adding the following steps to xref:Preparing_the_migration_environment_rhv_1-3_vddk[]:
