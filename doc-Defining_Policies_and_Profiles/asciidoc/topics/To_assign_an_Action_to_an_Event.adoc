This procedure describes how to assign an action to an event.

. Navigate to ControlExplorer.

. Click the Policies accordion, and select the policy you want to assign
actions to.

. From the Events area, click on the description of the event you want to
assign an action to.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (Configuration),
image:../images/1881.png[image] (Edit Actions for this Policy Event).

*Note*

Each selected action can be executed synchronously or asynchronously;
synchronous actions will not start until the previous synchronous action
is completed, and asynchronous action allows the next action to start
whether or not the first action has completed. Also, at least one
CloudForms Management Engine server in the CloudForms Management Engine
zone must have the notifier server role enabled for the trap to be sent.

of the policy.
