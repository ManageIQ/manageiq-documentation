= Detecting Drift on Hosts

Over time, the configuration of a Host might change.
Drift is the comparison of a host to itself at different points in time.
The host requires analysis at least twice to collect information.
Detecting drift provides you the following benefits:

* See the difference between the last known state of a host and its current state.
* Review the configuration changes that happen to a particular host between multiple points in time.
* Capture the configuration drifts for a single host across a time period.

. Navigate to menu:Infrastructure[Hosts].
. Click on the host to view drift.
. Click btn:[Relationships] in the Host Accordion.
. Click btn:[Drift History].
