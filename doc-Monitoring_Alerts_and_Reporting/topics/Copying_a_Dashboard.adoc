=== Copying a Dashboard to a Different Group of Users

As an administrator, it can be useful to share dashboard views with users who do not have permissions to manage resources.

You can copy a dashboard to another user group by completing the following steps as an administrative user:

. Navigate to menu:Overview[Reports].
. Click the *Dashboards* accordion, then select the dashboard to copy.
. Click  image:1847.png[] *(Configuration)*, then click  image:1851.png[] *(Copy Selected Dashboard)*.
. In the *Basic Information* area, enter a *Name* and *Description*.
. Select the group to make the dashboard available to.
. Click *Save*.

The copied dashboard is now available to all users in the group you selected.

To view the dashboards available to each group, click the *Dashboards* accordion, then *All Dashboards > All Groups*, and click the group to see a list.
