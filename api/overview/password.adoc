=== Password Updates

When the appliance is configured for Database authentication, users can update their passwords
via the REST API.

Note that if an authenticated REST API user is entitled to edit users, they can edit other
users' passwords, e.g. admin account.


Passwords can be updated via the *edit* post action on the user's resource as follows:

----
POST /api/users/:id
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "action" : "edit",
  "resource" : { "password" : "<new_password>" }
}
----

So for updating one's password, the _/api/users/:id_ being updated must be the authenticated REST API user's object.
