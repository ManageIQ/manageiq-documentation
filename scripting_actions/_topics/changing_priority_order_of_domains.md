Functions are executed depending on the order of Domain priority. Use
this procedure to change the priority order of domains.

1.  Navigate to menu:Automation\[Automate \> Explorer\]. The default
    view is the Datastore.

2.  Select the Domains you want to change the priority order for.

3.  Click ![image](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then
    ![image](../images/1851.png) (**Edit Priority Order of Domains**).

4.  The list of Domains selected shows up. Note that you cannot change
    the priority of locked Domains and therefore locked Domains do not
    show up on the list.

    their priority as required.

6.  Click **Save**.
