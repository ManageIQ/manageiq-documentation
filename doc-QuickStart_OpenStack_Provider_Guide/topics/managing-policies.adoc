{product-title_short} policies are associated with cloud instances using virtual machine analysis profiles. These are the steps required to create a custom virtual machine analysis profile, and assigning it to a cloud instance for use with SmartState analysis, via a control policy.

The following subsections demonstrate how to create host compliance and instance control policies.

[[create-host-compliance-policy]]
=== Creating a Host Compliance Policy

The following procedure describes how to create a compliance policy that checks whether firewalls are enabled on infrastructure provider nodes. Nodes with disabled firewalls are marked _non-compliant_.

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer].                         
. Expand the *Policies* accordion, and click *Compliance Policies*.
. Select *Host Compliance Policies*.
. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), image:../images/1862.png[image] (*Add a New Host/Node Compliance Policy*).
. Type in a *Description* for the policy.

+
. Uncheck *Active* if you do not want this policy processed even when assigned to a resource.
. Add *Host / Node.Firewall Rules : Active CONTAINS "true"* to the _scope_ of the policy . To do so:
.. In drop-down below the *Scope* section, choose *Field*. When you do, a new drop-down will appear below it; from there, select *Host/Node.Firewall.Rules: Active*.
.. A new drop-down will appear; from there, select *true*.
.. Click image:../images/1863.png[image] (*Commit expression element changes*) to add the scope.

. In the *Notes* area, add a detailed explanation of the policy.

. Click *Add*. The policy will be added and listed under *Host Compliance Policies* in the *Policies* accordion.

Next, create a _policy profile_ and assign this new compliance policy to it:

include::common/policies-creating-profiles.adoc[]

At this point, you can now add the new policy profile to the infrastructure provider hosts:

=== Creating a Virtual Machine Control Policy

The process of creating a _control policy_ is similar to that of a compliance policy. A control policy is driven by events after certain conditions are met. The following control policy will start a SmartState analysis on an instance every 24 hours:

// singlesource with manageiq_docs/art-Assigning_Custom_Analysis_Profile_to_VM/topics/To_create_VM_control_policy.adoc when able

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer].                         
. Expand the *Policies* accordion, and click *Control Policies*.
. Select *Vm Control Policies*.
. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), then image:../images/1862.png[image] (*Add a New VM and Instance Control Policy*).        
. Enter  a *Description*. This will be the name given to your VM control policy.     
. Uncheck *Active* if you do not want this policy processed even when assigned to a resource.
. Add *VM and Instance : Last Analysis Time IS "Yesterday"* to the scope of the policy. To do so:
.. In drop-down below the *Scope* section, choose *Field*. When you do, a new drop-down will appear below it; from there, select *VM and Instance : Last Analysis Time*.
.. A new drop-down will appear; from there, select *true*.
.. Click image:../images/1863.png[image] (*Commit expression element changes*) to add the scope.
. Click *Add*. The policy is added and listed under *Vm Control Policies* in the *Policies* accordion.

You can now associate events, conditions, and actions to this control policy. To do so:

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer].

. Click the *Policies* accordion, and select the control policy you just created.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), image:../images/1851.png[image] (*Edit this Policy's Condition assignments*).

. In the *VM Operation* section, select *VM Power On*.

. Click *Save*. The *VM Power On* event should appear under your policy.

You can now associate an action to the *VM Power On* event. To do so:

. Select the *VM Power On* event. 

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), then image:../images/1851.png[image] (*Edit Actions for this Policy Event*).

. In the *Order of Actions if ALL Conditions are True* section, select *Generate Log Message* and *Initiate SmartState Analysis for VM*.

. Click *Save*.

Next, create a policy profile and assign this new control policy to it:

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer].

. Click on the *Policy Profiles* accordion, then click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), then image:../images/1862.png[image] (*Add a New Policy Profile*).

. Enter `Most Recent SmartState` in the *Description* field. 

. In the *Policy Selection* area, choose the control policy you created earlier. This should have *VM and Instance Control* in its name. Add this policy to the *Profile Policies* box.

. Click *Add*. 

At this point, you should now be able to add the policy profile to the cloud providers.

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Cloud > Providers]. 
. Select the overcloud you added in xref:add-openstack-oc[].
. Click image:../images/1941.png[image] (*Policy*), then image:../images/1851.png[image] (*Manage Policies*).
. Under *Select Policy Profiles*, select *Most Recent SmartState*. 
. Click *Save*.
