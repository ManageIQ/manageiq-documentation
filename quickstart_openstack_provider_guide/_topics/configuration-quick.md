After deploying the appliance, log in with the root password `smartvm`.
If you deployed the appliance as a virtual machine, you can log in
through `virsh`:

    [root@kvm-host ~]# virsh console my-cfme
    Connected to domain my-cfme

### Configuring General {{ site.data.product.title_short }} Settings

After configuring the general settings for the appliance and creating a
database for it, you can now launch {{ site.data.product.title_short }}. To do this, use the
**Start EVM Server Processes** option from the appliance console
([Configuring General Appliance
Settings](#configuring_general_appliance_settings)). Once you launch
{{ site.data.product.title_short }}, note the **Hostname** and **IP Address** displayed on
the appliance console screen.

Open the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} web-based user interface by accessing either
**Hostname** and **IP Address** on a web browser. At the login screen,
use the following credentials:

  - Username: **admin**

  - Password: **smartvm**

**Note:**

You can also change the password of the **admin** account from the login
screen. To do so, click the **Update Password** link.

You can access and configure most {{ site.data.product.title_short }} settings through the
**Configuration** menu. You can access this menu through **Administrator | EVM** \> **Configuration**.

### Configuring {{ site.data.product.title_short }} Metrics for SmartState Analysis

You can also configure {{ site.data.product.title_short }} to perform a *SmartState
Analysis*. This type of analysis collects details such as accounts,
drivers, network information, hardware, and security patches on assets
managed by the OpenStack provider. Enabling SmartState Analysis involves
two steps:

1.  [Configuring {{ site.data.product.title_short }} Capacity and Utilization](#cf-caputils), and

2.  [Enabling SmartState Analysis](#cf-smartproxy)

These steps are required to allow {{ site.data.product.title_short }} to collect
metrics from OpenStack and use them to perform a SmartState analysis.
You can choose different servers to perform either function; the
following sections assume that you will.
