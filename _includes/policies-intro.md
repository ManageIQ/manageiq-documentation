Policies are used to manage your virtual environment. There are two types of policies available:
compliance and control. Compliance policies are used to harden your virtual infrastructure, making
sure that your security requirements are adhered to. Control policies are used to check for a
specific condition and perform an action based on the outcome. For example:

  - Prevent virtual machines from running without an administrator account.

  - Prevent virtual machines from starting if certain patches are not applied.

  - Configure the behavior of a production virtual machine to only start if it is running on a
    production host.

  - Force a SmartState Analysis when a host is added or removed from a cluster.
