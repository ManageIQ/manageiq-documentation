==== Retiring Virtual Machines and Instances

When a virtual machine or instance is no longer required, it can be retired. Once a virtual machine or instance reaches its retirement date, it is immediately shut down and not allowed to restart. If an attempt to restart is made, {product-title} will shut down the virtual machine or instance.

There are three built-in policies involved with retirement:

* If the virtual machine or instance reaches its retirement date, it will be stopped even if it is running.
* If a retired virtual machine or instance is requested to start through {product-title}, the virtual machine or instance will not be allowed to start.
* If a provider starts a retired virtual machine or instance outside of {product-title}, the virtual machine or instance will be stopped.

{product-title} provides a number of ways to retire a virtual machine or instance:

* By using the allocated buttons in the {product-title} console.
* When creating a provision request, a retirement date can be set up.
