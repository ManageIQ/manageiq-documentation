= Performing SmartState Analysis on an Instance or Image

Perform a SmartState Analysis of a configuration item to get updated information.
To analyze, a SmartProxy is required to have visibility to the instance's storage location and a provider so that a snapshot can be created.

. Navigate to menu:Clouds[Instances].
. Click the accordion for the items to analyze.
. Click the #Instance# or #Image# to analyze.
. Click  image:images/1847.png[] btn:[(Configuration)], and then  image:images/2147.png[] btn:[(Perform SmartState Analysis)] on the Taskbar.
. Click btn:[OK].

IMPORTANT: SmartState Analysis for instances runs as a process independent from providers.
For example, a successful SmartState Analysis of a host does not mean SmartState Analysis for instances will be successful.
Ensure to enter credentials for the provider that contains the instance for the SmartState Analysis to work.
