Set <guilabel>Mode</guilabel> to disabled to use Web services from the SmartProxy to the <productname>CloudForms Management Engine</productname> Appliance only. When the <productname>CloudForms Management Engine</productname> Appliance has work for the SmartProxy, the work will be placed in a queue in the VMDB. The work will be completed either when the <productname>CloudForms Management Engine</productname> Appliance is able to contact the SmartProxy or when the next SmartProxy heartbeat occurs, whichever comes first.
