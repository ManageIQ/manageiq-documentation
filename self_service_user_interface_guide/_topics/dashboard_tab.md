  - Monthly Charges - This Month To Date
    The Self Service user interface has added basic support for
    displaying monthly chargeback data of the computing and storage cost
    for the use of resources, in the currencies supported by the full
    administrative user interface. This provides a quick summary of
    where you are from cost standpoint to that point in the month. For
    more information about configuring chargeback rates in the full
    administrative user interface and how {{ site.data.product.title }} calculates
    chargeback costs, see
    [Chargeback](../monitoring_alerts_and_reporting/index.html#chargeback)
    in the *Monitoring, Alerts, and Reporting* guide.

<div class="note">

If you are on the first day of the month, there can be no data yet
therefore resulting in zero dollar amount. Also, if you have a lot of
data, it might not have rolled into the new month yet, resulting in no
data and dollar amount for month to date.
