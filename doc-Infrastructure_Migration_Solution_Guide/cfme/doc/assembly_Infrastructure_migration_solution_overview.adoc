= Infrastructure Migration Solution overview

Red Hat's Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) enables you to migrate your virtual machines from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization or to Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/[Red Hat Virtualization] (RHV) is an enterprise-grade virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With Red Hat Virtualization, you can manage your entire virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API.

link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform] provides the foundation to build a private or public Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It offers a massively scalable, fault-tolerant platform for the development of cloud-enabled workloads.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, IMS supports only cold migration. Virtual machines are powered off gracefully as part of the migration process.

+
* Assessing the source and target environments to ensure sufficient resources for migration
* Formulating strategies to minimize the impact on users

. xref:Preparing_the_migration_environment[Preparation]:
+
* Configuring the source and target environments
* Creating and configuring the conversion hosts

. xref:Migrating_the_infrastructure[Migration]:
+
* Mapping the resources of the source environment to the target environment
* Creating and running a migration plan

. xref:Validating_a_migration_plan[Validation]:
+
* Checking that the migration plan completed successfully
