|Question |Answer
|Where do I create a new provisioning profile based on a users LDAP
group? |Navigate to [`VM / Provisioning / Profile`] of either the *Cloud* or
*Infrastructure* namespace in your domain.

|Where can I specify a pre-dialog to present to a Requester in their
LDAP group? |Custom pre-dialogs can be defined in [`VM / Provisioning /
Profile / <LDAP Group Name>`] of either the *Cloud* or
*Infrastructure* namespace in your domain.

|I would like to customize our dialogs. Where are all the dialogs kept?
|All dialogs are located on each {product-title} appliance
in the `/var/www/miq/vmdb/db/fixtures` directory.

|What happens if I do not specify any profiles for provisioning?
|{product-title} searches for a matching LDAP group in the
[`VM / Provisioning / Profile`] class of either the *Cloud* or
*Infrastructure* namespace in your domain. If an LDAP profile is NOT found
then {product-title} will use the `missing class instance`.
