.Getting a Form
The URL to fetch a form is part of the [literal]+action+ serialization.
In a case when no form is referenced, the action does not require any attributes to be performed. 

Resource including an action with a Form:

{
  "href" : "Ref(self)",
  "id" : Integer,
  "name" : "resource human name",
  "actions": [
    {
	"name    : "edit",
	"method" : "post",
	"form"   : { "href" : "https://hostname/vms?form_for=edit" },
	"href"   : "URL"

Example of a Form:

{
  "required" : [ "name", "host" ],
  "optional" : [ "description" ]
  "internal" : [ "power_state", "created_on"]
}

The following describes the semantics of the attribute identifiers: 

* required - these attributes must be specified for the action to be carried out. 
* optional - these are optional attributes, which may be specified and processed by the action.
  These may be shown in a UI but not enforced. 
* internal - it is not necessary to define these, but they are required for a UI form to show and extended a form with more attributes than the required and optional identifiers permit.
  This identifier shows what attributes are system managed and not modifiable by the REST client.
