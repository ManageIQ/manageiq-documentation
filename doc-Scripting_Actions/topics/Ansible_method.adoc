==== Creating a Playbook Automate Method

{product-title} can choose an Ansible playbook from a repository and execute it as a method. Each playbook method can take additional input parameters specified by the user.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* You must first sync your playbook repositories before using them to create a method. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html/managing_providers/automation_management_providers#adding-a-playbook-repository[Adding a Playbook Repository] in _Managing Providers_ for information on initial playbook repository set-up.
* Using Ansible playbooks to populate dynamic dialog fields is not recommended due to delay times caused by the overhead of interaction between systems.
* Only users with administrator privileges can run a service dialog based on a playbook automate method.
====

To create a playbook automate method:

. Navigate to menu:Automation[Automate > Explorer], then click on a domain under *Datastore*.
. Under a namespace, select the class for which you want to create a new method.
. Click the *Methods* tab.
. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*) then,
image:../images/1862.png[image] (*Add a New Method*).
. In the *Main Info* area, select *playbook* from the drop-down menu.
. Provide a *Name* and *Display Name*.
. Select a playbook *Repository* from the list.
.. Choose a *Playbook* to use.
.. Select the *Machine Credential* the playbook will use when it runs.
.. Select the *Vault Credential* to use.
.. From the *Cloud Type* list, select a cloud provider.
.. Choose the *Cloud Credential* that corresponds to the selected cloud type.
. Specify the *Hosts* on which the playbook will run. Choose *Localhost* or provide unique values in the *Specify host values* field.
. Set the *Max TTL* in minutes. The Time To Live (TTL) field allows you to set the maximum execution time for the playbook to run.
. Select when to receive *Logging Output* from the options in the drop-down menu.
. Use the *Escalate Privilege* toggle switch to enable user privilege escalation if credentials are called for during the playbook run.
. Choose a *Verbosity* value to set the debug level for playbook execution.
. Add required *Input Parameters* using the fields and values available. Click the image:add_parameter.png[] to add additional input parameters.

[NOTE]
====
Input parameters become extra vars, with substitution enabled. This overcomes the lack of a dialog which would normally allow for the input of additional information. For more information on extra vars, see the Ansible documentation.

. Click *Add* when finished.

Once created, a playbook method can be exported to appliances in your testing or production environments or imported in appliances in multiple regions. See <<exporting-all-datastore-classes>> to export datastore classes.
