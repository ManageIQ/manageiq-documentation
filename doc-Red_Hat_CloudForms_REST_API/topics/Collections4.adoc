[[_collections4]]
= Collections

Resources can be grouped into collections.
Each collection is unordered, and is homogeneous so that it contains only one type of resource.
Resources can also exist outside any collection; these resources are referred to as singleton resources.
Collections are themselves resources as well. 

Collections can exist globally, at the top level of an API, and can also be contained inside a single resource.
The latter are referred to as sub-collections.
Sub-collections are usually used to express a relationship where one resource is contained within another. 

Collections are serialized in JSON in the following way:

----

{
  "name" : "String",
  "count": String,
  "subcount": String,
  "resources": [ ... ],
  "actions": [ ... ]
}
----

The [literal]+count+ attribute in a collection always denotes the total number of items in the collection, not the number of items returned.
The [literal]+subcount+ attribute in a collection depicts the number of items returned.
The [literal]+resources+ attribute is an Array[T], where T might be a list of references to the T or, if expanded, a list of resources with all attributes.
The [literal]+actions+ attribute contains an Array of actions that can be performed against the collection resources.
