## Settings Overview

Use the **Settings** menus of the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} user
interface to view or modify the global configuration of your appliance.

**Settings**

To view or modify global settings for your appliance, click **Settings** > **My Settings** to modify. The availability of each menu item
depends on the role assigned to your user account. For more information on roles, see [Roles](#roles).

The following menu items are available from the settings menu:

  - **My Settings**

    This menu is available to all {{ site.data.product.title_short }} users. The settings in
    this menu control how elements in the user interface are displayed,
    time profiles, and tags for the currently logged-in individual user.

  - **Tasks**

    This menu allows you to view virtual machine SmartState Analysis
    tasks that can be tracked through the console. The status of each
    task is displayed, including time started, time ended, what part of
    the task is currently running, and any errors encountered.

**Application Settings**

The **Application Settings** menu is now accessible from **Settings** > **Application Settings** from the user
interface.

This menu allows you to specify enterprise, region, zone, and server settings for your {{ site.data.product.title_short }} infrastructure. Diagnostics such as logs and the status of processes are also shown here.
