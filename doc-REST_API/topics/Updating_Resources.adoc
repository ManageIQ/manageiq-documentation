==== Updating Resources

Use the following methods to update attributes in a resource: 

* Update a resource via the `PUT` HTTP Method
* Update a resource via a `POST` Method with an *edit* action. 
* Update a resource via the `PATCH` HTTP Method

While `PUT` is the common method, the `PATCH` mechanism gives better control on which attribute to edit or add, and enables removal, which is not available with the other two methods.
