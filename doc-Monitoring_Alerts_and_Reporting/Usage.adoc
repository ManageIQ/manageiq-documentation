= Usage

Usage provides a targeted view of CPU, RAM, disk space, disk I/O, and network I/O for tagged virtual machines.
This allows you to find which virtual machines are using or overusing resources. 

There are two requirements to use this feature: 

* You must assign tags to the virtual machines that you want to collect usage data for.
  See "Tagging Virtual Machines and Templates" in Managing Infrastructure and Inventory. 
* Capacity and utilization collection must be enabled.
  For more information on configuring capacity and utilization charts, see the Deployment Planning Guide.
