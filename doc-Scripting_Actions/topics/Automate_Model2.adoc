=== Automate Model

The Automate model is arranged to provide an object oriented hierarchy
to control automation functions. The model uses the following
organizational units arranged in a hierarchy:

* *Datastore* - The main organization unit that stores the entire model.
* *Domains* - Domains act as collection of automation functions. Functions
are executed depending on the order of Domain priority, which means a
function in a Domain with a higher priority overrides the same functions
specified in a lower-priority Domain. This allows {product-title} to specify a core Domain (ManageIQ) but allow users to override
automate functions with custom Domains. Each Domain contains a set of
Namespaces.
* *Namespaces* - Containers that organize and categorize functions of the
model. Namespaces can contain child Namespaces as well as Classes.
* *Classes* - Templates for a specific function of the model. Each Class
uses a Schema to apply to Instances to populate with default values.
Each class also can contain a set of methods.
* *Instances* - An instance is a version of a class populated with initial
configuration data. An instance can include a collection of any number
of attributes, calls to methods, and relationships.
* *Methods* - Methods are functions within the model. Methods use Ruby
code to execute various operations needed for a Class.

{product-title} contains a set of preconfigured Domains for
users:

* *ManageIQ* - The core domain for {product-title} Automate
operations. This domain is locked with the following Namespaces:
** *Cloud* - General cloud instance lifecycle from provisioning,
retirement, methods, email.
** *Control* - Control contains email alerts for policy controls.
** *Infrastructure* - General infrastructure VM lifecycle from
provisioning, retirement, methods, email.
** *Service* - Service lifecycle from provisioning, retirement, methods,
email.
** *System* - System contains classes that can provide the start points
for all {product-title} Automate activities.
* *RedHat* - Domain containing advanced operations, specifically
interactions with supported cloud and infrastructure providers. This
domain is locked with the following Namespaces:
** *Cloud* - Red Hat-supported cloud instance lifecycle from provisioning,
retirement, methods, email.
** *Infrastructure* - Red Hat-supported cloud instance lifecycle from
provisioning, retirement, methods, email.
** *Integration* - Used to interface with systems outside of {product-title}. Use this namespace to integrate with additional
systems.

You can copy classes and instances from locked Domains into your own
custom domains.

[NOTE]
====
Changing the existing classes or instances shipped with the product is not recommended because this may hinder the operation of {product-title}. You can link to these methods using relationships.
