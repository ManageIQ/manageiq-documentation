= Containers Providers

A containers provider is a service that manages container resources, and can be added to the {product-title} appliance.

The menu:Compute[Containers] area has options to add and manage containers providers. This includes the *Providers* page, which displays all discovered or added containers providers.

{product-title} supports adding OpenShift Enterprise as a containers provider.
