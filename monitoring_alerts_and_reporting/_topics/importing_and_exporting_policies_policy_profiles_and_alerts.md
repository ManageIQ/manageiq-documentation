### Importing and Exporting Policies, Policy Profiles, and Alerts

If you have multiple VMDBs, you can export policies, policy profiles, or
alerts from one to another. You can export and import for use with other
{{ site.data.product.title_short }} infrastructures.

**Note:**

The appliances you are exporting or importing data between must use the
same {{ site.data.product.title_short }} version.

1.  Copy the file to import to a location that is accessible to your
    {{ site.data.product.title_short }} console.

2.  Navigate to **Control > Import/Export**.

3.  Click **Choose file** to navigate to the location of the file.

4.  Select the file, and then click **Open** from the file selection
    box.

5.  Click **Upload**.

6.  Verify that these are the policies or policy profiles that you want
    to import.

7.  Click **Commit**.
