image:circle_step_numbers/1.png[25,25] You create and run a migration plan in the CloudForms user interface.

image:circle_step_numbers/2.png[25,25] CloudForms uses the migration plan to locate the VMware virtual machines.

image:circle_step_numbers/3.png[25,25] CloudForms captures the VMware ESXi host fingerprint for authentication during the migration process.

ifdef::rhv_1-1_vddk,rhv_1-2_vddk[]
image:circle_step_numbers/4.png[25,25] CloudForms initiates communication with the RHV conversion hosts. RHV conversion hosts are bare metal hosts with `virt-v2v` and `virt-v2v-wrapper` installed.
endif::[]
ifdef::rhv_1-3_vddk[]
image:circle_step_numbers/4.png[25,25] CloudForms initiates communication with the RHV conversion hosts. RHV conversion hosts are virtual machines with `virt-v2v` and `virt-v2v-wrapper` installed.
endif::[]
ifdef::osp_1-1_vddk,osp_1-2_vddk,osp_1-3_vddk[]
image:circle_step_numbers/4.png[25,25] CloudForms initiates communication with the RHOSP conversion hosts. RHOSP conversion hosts are RHOSP instances with `virt-v2v` and `virt-v2v-wrapper` installed.
endif::[]

image:circle_step_numbers/5.png[25,25] The `virt-v2v-wrapper` connects to the VMware datastore through the ESXi host. `virt-v2v` streams the VMware virtual disks to the Red Hat data domain and converts the disks.

ifdef::rhv_1-1_vddk,rhv_1-2_vddk,rhv_1-3_vddk[]
image:circle_step_numbers/6.png[25,25] The `virt-v2v-wrapper` creates a RHV virtual machine and uses the VMware virtual machine’s metadata to preserve its attributes (tags, power state, MAC address, CPU count, memory, disks, and virtual machine name) after migration.

image:circle_step_numbers/7.png[25,25] `virt-v2v` attaches the converted disks to the RHV virtual machine. The RHV virtual machine's power state is the same as the VMware virtual machine's power state.
endif::[]
ifdef::osp_1-1_vddk,osp_1-2_vddk,osp_1-3_vddk[]
image:circle_step_numbers/6.png[25,25] After the VMware virtual disks are converted, `virt-v2v` detaches the volumes from the RHOSP conversion host, migrates the volumes to the RHOSP project, and creates the network ports defined in the infrastructure mapping.

image:circle_step_numbers/7.png[25,25] `virt-v2v-wrapper` creates a RHOSP instance with the flavor and security group defined in the migration plan. `virt-v2v` attaches the newly created network ports and the disks mapped in the block storage to the instance. The instance is powered on.
endif::[]

The migration process is complete and the migration plan status is displayed in the CloudForms user interface.
