Key pairs allow you to manage SSH access between a user and provisioned instance. For more information about key pairs in OpenStack, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/instances-and-images-guide/chapter-3-virtual-machine-instances#section-manage-keypair[Manage Key Pairs] from the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/instances-and-images-guide/instances-and-images-guide[Red Hat OpenStack Platform Instances and Images Guide].

To manage key pairs, navigate to menu:Compute[Clouds > Key Pairs]. From there, you can view a list of available key pairs. Click on a key pair to view its details.

To create a new key pair:

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Clouds > Key Pairs].

. Click image:1847.png[](*Configuration*), image:2345.png[](*Add a new Key Pair*).

. Enter a *Name* for the key pair.

. If you want to use a public key, copy its contents into the *Public Key (optional)* field.

. Select which cloud provider on which to create the key pair. The key pair will then be available for use by instances in that provider.

. Click *Add*.

// TODO: NEED TO add steps for using keypair info for streamlining SSH access to instance that uses a keypair. When creating a keypair in OpenStack, a downloadable PEM key is created that you can immediately use in accessing the instance via SSH. No such PEM key is made available when creating key pairs via CFME.
