== Collection Filtering

When querying collections, filters can be specified by providing
one or more filter[]=... parameter.

----
GET /api/:collection?filter[]=...&filter[]=...&filter[]=...
----

Syntax for a filter is as follows:

----
filter[]=attribute op value
----

By default, filters are logically _anded_ together, for a logical or, prefix the attribute with _or_ as follows:

----
filter[]=or attribute op value
----

Where op supports the following operators:

[cols="1,1,3",options="header"]
|=================================================
| Operator | Description | Operands
|=   | Equality              .2+|
Numeric or string. For String, supports % or * as wildcard

NULL or nil can also be specified instead of quoted string
|!=  | Inequality
|<   | Less Than             | Numeric
|\<= | Less Than or Equal    | Numeric
|>=  | Greater Than or Equal | Numeric
|>   | Greater Than          | Numeric
|=================================================


When strings, value to be quoted in single or double quotes.
When datetimes, only strict comparison operators are supported.

Example Query VMs named sample*, created_on > 2019-09-01, and return name and vendor

----
GET /api/vms?expand=resources&attributes=name,vendor&filter[]=created_on>2019-09-01&filter[]=name='sample%'
----

Example Query looking for services that are retired but have an unspecified service_id

----
GET /api/services?expand=resources&attributes=retired&filter[]=service_id=nil&filter[]=retired=true

Attributes specified via the filter[] parameter can include virtual attributes, including
one level association of the virtual attribute as follows:

The HTTP **OPTIONS** request can be used on a collection to display all of the collection
specific metadata, including the available virtual attributes. For more information please
