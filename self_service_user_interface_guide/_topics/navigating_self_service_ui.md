## Navigating the Self Service User Interface

The Self Service user interface has a slideout navigation menu on the
left that can be minimized by clicking the menu icon (≡), like in the
full administrative user interface. The slideout navigation menu
comprises of the following tabs:

  - **Dashboard**

  - **My Services**

  - **My Orders**

  - **Service Catalogs**

The menu bar that runs along the top of the user interface contains
several options including a shopping cart, notifications feature, full
administrative user interface option, and a help option. Besides that,
you can see the current logged in LDAP user, for example,
**Administrator**.

  - Shopping Cart
    Click the shopping cart icon to view services that are available to
    order, manage your cart as required, and order all services at one
    time. You can read more about the shopping cart model adopted in the
    Self Service user interface under [???](#service-catalog-tab).

  - Notifications
    The Self Service user interface has introduced a new notifications
    feature that displays messages generated by the system for various
    events, such adding services to the shopping cart, ordering
    services, provisioning, service power operations, and so on. Click
    the bell icon to open or close the **Notifications** drawer, which
    shows various notification events. You can click the double arrows
    (![Double Arrows Icon](/images/ssui_doublearrows_icon.png)) located
    on the upper-left of the **Notifications** drawer to expand or
    contract the size of the **Notifications** screen as required.

  - Administration User Interface Link
    Clicking the menu icon (![Administration UI
    icon](/images/ssui-administration-ui-icon.png)) shows the
    **Administration UI** link, which when clicked, takes you to the
    full administrative user interface login page in a new window or tab
    of your web browser.

  - Help
    Click the help icon to access the options to open **Documentation**,
    **Red Hat Customer Portal**, and **About**. Click **About** to see
    information about your Self Service environment, such as the logged
    in user name and role, the browser details, and importantly, the
    Self Service user interface version number, which can be useful for
    support purposes.

The resources linked to in the help icon will be, by default, the ones
listed above. System administrators can change them to other resources
as required for the logged in user.

  - Role-Based Access Control
    The Self Service user interface supports role-based access control
    of menus and features. If you are a member of multiple user groups,
    you can change the acting group by navigating to ***Administrator***
    \> **Change Group**, then select the new group from the available
    options in the list.

  - Switch Language
    Although you can set your preferred language for the user interface
    from the login screen itself, you can switch to a different language
    than what is currently set also by navigating to ***Administrator***
    \> **Switch Language** within the Self Service user interface.
