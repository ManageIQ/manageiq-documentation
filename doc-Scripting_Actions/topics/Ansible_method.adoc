==== Creating a Playbook Automate Method

{product-title} can choose an Ansible playbook from a repository and execute it as a method. Each playbook method can take additional input parameters specified by the user. 

[NOTE]
====
You must first sync your playbook repositories before using them to create a method. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6-beta/html/managing_providers/automation_management_providers#adding-a-playbook-repository[Adding a Playbook Repository] in _Managing Providers_ for information on initial playbook repository set-up.

====
Input parameters become extra vars, with substition enabled. This overcomes the lack of a dialog which would normally allow for the input of additional information. For more information on extra vars, see the Ansible documentation.
