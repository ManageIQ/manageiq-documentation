= Applying SCAP Standards

The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is a set of standards to assist with vulnerability management and policy compliance. {product-title} provides a set of SCAP standards to apply to your appliance.

.  Enter the `appliance_console` command. The {product-title} Appliance summary screen displays.
.  Press `Enter` to manually configure settings.
.  Select `Harden Appliance Using SCAP Configuration`.

.  When complete, press any key to return to the summary screen.
