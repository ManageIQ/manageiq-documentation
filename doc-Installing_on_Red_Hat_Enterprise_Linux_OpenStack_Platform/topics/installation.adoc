== Installing {product-title}

{product-title} is able to be installed and ready to configure in a few quick steps. After downloading {product-title} as a virtual machine image template from the Red Hat Customer Portal, the installation process takes you through the steps of uploading the appliance to a supported virtualization or cloud provider.

[IMPORTANT]
=======
After installing the {product-title} appliance, you must configure the database for {product-title}. See xref:configuring_a_database[].

[[uploading-the-appliance-on-openstack]]
=== Uploading the Appliance on OpenStack

Log in to your OpenStack dashboard to upload your {product-title} appliance.

. Log in to the OpenStack dashboard.
. In the *Project* tab, navigate to menu:Compute[Images].
. Click *Create Image*.
. In *Name*, enter a name for the image.
. From *Image Source* list, select *Image Location*. Note that currently only images available via an HTTP URL are supported.
. In *Image Location*, add an external (HTTP) URL to load the image from.
  For example, *http://example.com/image.iso*.
. From the *Format* list, select the image format. For example, `ISO - Optical Disk Image`.
. Specify the *Architecture*. For example, `i386` for a 32-bit architecture or `x86-64` for a 64-bit architecture.
. Leave the *Minimum Disk (GB)* and *Minimum RAM (MB)* fields empty.
. Check the *Public* box to make the appliance available to all users.
. Check the *Protected* box to protect the image from being accidentally deleted.
. Click *Create Image*.

You have successfully uploaded the {product-title} appliance.

The appliance image is placed in a queue to be uploaded. It may take some time before the Status of the image changes from Queued to Active.


[[adding-a-rule-to-a-security-group]]
=== Adding a Rule to a Security Group

Security groups specify what IP traffic is allowed to reach an instance on its public IP address. Security group rules are processed before network traffic reaches firewall rules defined within the guest itself.


[NOTE]
======
In the default configuration, the default security group accepts all connections from the default source; all instances within the default group can talk to each other on any port.
======

. From the OpenStack dashboard, navigate to menu:Project[Compute > Access & Security].
. Navigate to menu:Security Groups[Manage Rules] on the row for the default security group.
image:7216.png[title="Manage Security Group Rules: default"]
. Click *Add Rule*.
image:4941.png[title="Add Rule Dialog"]
. Configure the rule.
.. Select menu:Rule[Custom TCP Rule].
.. Select menu:Direction[Ingress].
.. Select *Port* from the *Open Port* list.
.. Specify `443` in the *Port* field.
.. Select *CIDR* from the *Remote* list.
.. Specify `0.0.0.0/0` in the *CIDR* field.
.. Click *Add*.

[[creating-a-custom-flavor]]
=== Creating a Custom Flavor

A flavor is a resource allocation profile that specifies, for example, how many virtual CPUs and how much RAM can be allocated to an instance. You can, for example, run {product-title} on a Red Hat OpenStack m1.large flavor, which specifies a virtual machine with 4
cores, 8GB RAM, and 80GB disk space. Creating a flavor to run {product-title} is optional.

The following procedure demonstrates creating a flavor with the minimum requirements (4 cores, 8GB RAM, 44GB disk space) for {product-title}. For more information about flavors, see the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Administration User Guide.

. Log in to the OpenStack dashboard as admin.
. In the *Admin* tab, navigate to menu:System[Flavors].
. Click *Create Flavor* to display the *Create Flavor* dialog.
. Configure the settings to define a flavor that meets {product-title} system requirements.
.. Enter a name for the flavor.
.. Enter the following settings:
+
* *VCPUs*: 4
* *RAM MB*: 8192
* *Root Disk GB*: 45
* *Ephemeral Disk GB*: 0
* *Swap Disk MB*: 0
+
. Click *Create Flavor*.

A new flavor specific to {product-title} is created.

[[launching-the-instance]]
=== Launching the Instance

. From the OpenStack dashboard, navigate to menu:Project[Compute > Instances].
. Click *Launch Instance*.
. Enter a name for the instance.
. Select the custom flavor for your instance. The flavor selection determines the computing resources available to your instance. The resources used by the flavor are displayed in the *Flavor Details* pane.
. Enter *1* in the *Instance Count* field.
. Select a boot option from the *Instance Boot Source* list:
+
* *Boot from image* - displays a new field for *Image Name*. Select the image from the drop-down list.
* *Boot from snapshot* - displays a new field for *Instance Snapshot*. Select the snapshot from the drop-down list.
* *Boot from volume* - displays a new field for  *Volume*. Select the volume from the drop-down list.
* *Boot from image (creates a new volume)* - boot from an image and create a volume by choosing *Device Size* and *Device Name* for your volume. Some volumes can be persistent. To ensure the volume is deleted when the instance is deleted, select *Delete on Terminate*.
* *Boot from volume snapshot (creates a new volume)* - boot from volume snapshot and create a new volume by choosing *Volume Snapshot* from the drop-down list and adding a *Device Name* for your volume. Some volumes can be persistent. To ensure the volume is deleted when the instance is deleted, select *Delete on Terminate*.
+
. Click *Networking* and select a network for the instance by clicking the *+* (plus) button for the network from *Available Networks*.
. Click *Launch*.

[[adding-a-floating-ip-address]]
=== Adding a Floating IP Address

When you create an instance, Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform automatically assigns it a fixed IP address in the network to which the instance belongs. This IP address is permanently associated with the instance until the instance is terminated.

In addition to the fixed address, you can also assign a floating IP address to an instance. Unlike fixed IP addresses, you can modify floating IP addresses associations at any time, regardless of the state of the instances involved.

. At the command-line on your RHEL OpenStack Platform host, create a pool of floating IP addresses using the `nova-manage floating create` command. Replace *IP_BLOCK* with the desired block of IP addresses expressed in CIDR notation.
+
------
$ nova-manage floating create IP_BLOCK
------
+
. In the *Project* tab, navigate to menu:Compute[Access & Security].
. Click menu:Floating IPs[Allocate IP To Project]. The *Allocate Floating IP* window is displayed.
image:7218.png[title="Allocate Floating IP"]
. Click *Allocate IP* to allocate a floating IP from the pool. The allocated IP address appears in the *Floating IPs* table.
. Select the newly allocated IP address from the *Floating IPs* table.
  Click *Associate* to assign the IP address to a specific instance.
image:7217.png[title="Manage Floating IP Associations"]
. Select an instance with which to associate the floating IP Address.
. Click *Associate* to associate the IP address with the selected instance.

[NOTE]
======
To disassociate a floating IP address from an instance when it is no longer required, click *Release Floating IPs*.
