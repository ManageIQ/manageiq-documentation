[[targeting-instances]]
=== Targeting Instances

These actions can be triggered on individual instance resources:

[source,data]
----

As simply as POSTing the following action to an instance.

[source,json]

{
  "action" : "start"
}
----


Requests can also be made on multiple instances by targeting the primary collection:

[source,data]
----
/api/instances
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "action" : "start",
  "resources" : [
    { "href" : "http://localhost:3000/api/instances/101" },
    { "href" : "http://localhost:3000/api/instances/102" },
    ...
  ]
}
