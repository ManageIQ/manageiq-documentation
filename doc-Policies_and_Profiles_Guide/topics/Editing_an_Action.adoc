=== Editing an Action

Edit an action to modify its properties. You cannot edit any of the default actions supplied with {product-title}. Only actions that you create can be changed.

Note that when you view an action, you can see what policies it has been assigned to.

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer].

. Click the *Actions* accordion, then click on the action you need to edit.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), image:../images/1851.png[image] (*Edit this Action*) on the detail view of the action.

. Make any required changes.

. Click *Save*.

The action is modified and can be added to a policy. If the action is already party of a policy, the policy is automatically updated.
