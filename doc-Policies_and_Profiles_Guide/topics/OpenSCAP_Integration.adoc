OpenSCAP is an auditing tool used for hardening the security of your enterprise. This tool is built upon the knowledge and resources provided by the many experienced security experts active in the upstream OpenSCAP ecosystem. For more information about OpenSCAP, see https://www.open-scap.org/.

{product-title} now supports OpenSCAP. By default, {product-title} provides a built-in _OpenSCAP policy profile_ which provides policies for managing the security of your _container images_.

These policies ensure that new container images from any provider within {product-title} are scanned against the latest CVE content from Red Hat. See Red Hat's https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/[Security Data] page for more details about this content. In particular, the https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/ds[SCAP source data stream files index] provides examples of security advisories used by the built-in OpenSCAP policy profile.

Each of these security advisories have a severity ranging from *Low* to *Critical*. With the built-in OpenSCAP policy profile, any image that fails a security check against an advisory with at least a *High* severity is marked as non-compliant.

The built-in OpenSCAP policy profile cannot be edited. You can, however, edit copies of its policies and assign those copies to a new profile. See xref:openscap-custom[] for more information.

==== Assigning the Built-In OpenSCAP Policy Profile

The OpenSCAP policy profile included with {product-title} is not automatically assigned. You still need to assign it to a container provider. The method for doing so is similar to that of any normal policy profile (as in xref:profile-assign[]):

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Providers], check the providers you need to assign the OpenSCAP policy profile to.

. Click image:../images/1941.png[image] (*Policy*), and then click image:../images/1851.png[image](*Manage Policies*).

. From the *Select Policy Profiles* area, click on the triangle next to *OpenSCAP profile* to expand it and see its member policies.

. Check *OpenSCAP profile*. It turns blue to show its assignment state has changed.

. Click *Save*.

==== Scheduling an OpenSCAP Compliance Check on Container Images

Once you have assigned the built-in OpenSCAP policy profile to a container provider, you can schedule a compliance check against the policy profile. The method for doing is similar to that of scheduling a normal compliance check (xref:compliance-schedule[]):

include::steps_schedule-compliance-check.adoc[]

. From the *Action* dropdown, select *Container Image Analysis*.

. From the *Filter* dropdown, select *All Container Images for Containers Provider*, a new dropdown will appear. From this dropdown, choose the provider where you enabled the OpenSCAP policy profile.

=== Creating a Customized OpenSCAP Policy Profile

The built-in OpenSCAP policy profile cannot be edited. You can, however, assign _edited_ copies of its policies to a new policy profile. This will allow you to create a _customized_ version of the built-in OpenSCAP policy profile.

To do so, you will first have to copy the policy you want to customize:

include::Copying_a_Policy-steps.adoc[]

You can now edit the copied policy. For instructions on how to edit policies, see:

* xref:policy-edit-basic[]
* xref:policy-edit-condition-assignment[]
* xref:policy-edit-event-assignment[]

After editing copied policies, you can now add them to a new policy profile. For instructions on how to create a new policy profile (and add policies to it), see xref:profiles-create[]. 

Once you have a customized policy profile, you can assign it to a container provider. See xref:profile-assign[] for instructions.
