. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*, then select the server to configure from menu:Settings[Zone] in the accordion menu on the left.
. Navigate to the *Server Roles* list in the menu:Server[Server Control] section. From there, set the required capacity and utilization roles to *ON*, namely:
.. *Capacity & Utilization Coordinator*
.. *Capacity & Utilization Data Collector*
.. *Capacity & Utilization Data Processor*
. Click *Save*.

Data collection is enabled immediately. However, the first collection begins
5 minutes after the server is started, and every 10 minutes after that.
Therefore, the longest the collection takes after enabling the Capacity &
Utilization Collector role is 10 minutes. The first collection
from a particular provider may take a few minutes since {product-title}
is gathering data points going one month back in time.
