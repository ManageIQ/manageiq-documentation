= Insight and Control

{product-title} can connect to OpenShift Enterprise containers providers and manage them similarly to the way that infrastructure and cloud providers are managed. This allows you to gain control over different aspects of your environment and answer questions, such as:

* How many containers exist in my environment?
* Does a specific node have enough resources?
* How many distinct images are used?
* Which image registries are used?

When {product-title} connects to a containers environment, it collects information on different areas of the environment:

* Entities such as pods, nodes, or services.
* Basic relationships between the entities, for example: Which services are serving which pods?
* Advanced insight into relationships, for example: Which two different containers are using the same image?
* Additional information, such as events, projects, routes, and metrics.

You can manage policies for containers entities by adding tags. All containers entities except volumes can be tagged.

[[cross-providers-insight]]
== Cross-Providers Insight

Cross-providers insight is a feature that connects all layers of infrastructure, cloud, and containers known to {product-title} and collects data for analysis.

It supports cross-linking all of the layers available in the following environments:

* OpenStack
* Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
* VMware vCenter
* Amazon EC2
* Google Cloud Engine

The collected information includes all the data available in other (infrastructure or cloud) providers.

[NOTE]
====
For Amazon EC2 (AWS) and Google Cloud Engine (GCE) support, OpenShift must be installed using the relevant cloud provider. For more information, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise/3.2/installation-and-configuration/installation-and-configuration[OpenShift Enterprise Installation and Configuration] guide.
