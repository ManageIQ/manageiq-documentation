# Introduction to Authentication in {{ site.data.product.title_short }}

{{ site.data.product.title }} provides several methods to authenticate users.
Authentication can be configured from {{ site.data.product.title_short }} using the
local database, or {{ site.data.product.title_short }} can use protocols such as LDAP
and SAML to connect to a pre-configured authentication system such as
Red Hat Identity Management (IdM), Red Hat Single Sign-On (SSO), Active
Directory (AD), or AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to use
existing user accounts and groups.

This guide provides instructions to configure authentication management
in your {{ site.data.product.title_short }} environment as an administrative user.

After completing the setup of an authentication system, users can log in
with their credentials.
