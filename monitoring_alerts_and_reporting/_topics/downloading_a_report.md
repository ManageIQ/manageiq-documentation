view the report in a full screen.

1.  Browse to menu: **Overview > Reports**.

2.  Click the report you want to view.

3.  Click on the row for the instance of the report you want to
    download. If the report needs to be generated, see
    [???](#running_reports).

4.  Click on the report download buttons for the type of export you
    want.

      - Click ![textimage](../images/textimage.png) (**Download this
        report in text format**) to download as text.

      - Click ![textimage](../images/textimage.png) (**Download this
        report in csv format**) to download as a comma-separated file.

      - Click ![2134](../images/2134.png) (**Download this report in PDF
        format**) to download as PDF.

      - The report is automatically named with the type of report and
        date.

**Note:**

administrators. Edit and delete functions are only available to
customer-created reports. The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} pre-configured reports
cannot be edited or deleted, but they can be copied.
