_Live migration_ involves moving a live instance between Compute nodes. Live migration is useful for avoiding instance downtime during cloud maintenance or load management. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/version-8/migrating-instances/#how_to_migrate_a_live_instance[How to Migrate a Live Instance] in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform _Migrating Instances_ guide for details on the underlying OpenStack process.

To migrate a live instance:

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Clouds > Instances].

. On the right pane, click the instance to be migrated. Use the *Instances by Provider* accordion to filter instances by provider and/or availability zone.

. Click image:2007.png[](*Lifecycle*), then image:2097.png[] (*Migrate selected Instance*).

. On the *Migrate Instance* section, select your preferred migration options:
** *Auto-select Host?*: let the OpenStack provider automatically choose a destination Compute node. If you prefer to choose a specific node, uncheck this option and choose from the *Destination Host* dropdown.
** *Block Migration*: check this option to perform a _block-based_ migration. With this migration, the entire virtual machine image is moved from the source node to the destination node. If your OpenStack provider uses _shared storage_, leave this option unchecked. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/version-8/migrating-instances/#prerequisites[Prerequisites] in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform _Migrating Instances_ guide for related information.
** *Disk Over Commit*: check this option to prevent the OpenStack provider from verifying first whether the destination host has available disk space to host the instance.

. Click *Submit*.

Once the migration initiates, the instance list will reload with a message indicating that the selected instance is being migrated. Upon completion, the instance list will reload and the evacuated instance will be displayed as image:2143.png[] (*On*).
