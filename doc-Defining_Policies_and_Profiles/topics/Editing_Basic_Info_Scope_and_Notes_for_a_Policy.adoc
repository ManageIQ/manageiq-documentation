==== Editing Basic Information, Scope, and Notes for a Policy

As your enterprise's needs change, you can change the name of a policy
or its scope. If the items being evaluated are out of scope, policy
processing stops and no actions run.

. Navigate to `Control` -> `Explorer`.

. Click the `Policies` accordion, and select the policy to edit.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (`Configuration`),
image:../images/1851.png[image] (`Edit Basic Info, Scope, and Notes`).

. In the `Scope` area, create a general condition based on a simple
attribute. Or, click on an existing expression to edit it. Based on what
you choose, different options appear. Recall that a scope is optional
for a policy.

if it is tagged as production.

* Click `Find` to seek a particular value, and then check a property. For
example, finding the `Admin` account and checking that it is enabled.
Use the following check commands:
** `Check Any`: The result is true if one or more of the find results
satisfy the check condition.
** `Check All`: All of the find results must match for a true result.
** `Check Count`: If the result satisfies the expression in check count,
the result is true.

* Click `Registry` to create criteria based on registry values. For
example, you can check if DCOM is enabled on a Windows System. Note that
this applies only to Windows operating systems. Registry will only be
available if you are editing a VM Control Policy.
