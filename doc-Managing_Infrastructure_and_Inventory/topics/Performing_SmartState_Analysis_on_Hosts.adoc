= Performing SmartState Analysis on Hosts

Perform a SmartState analysis on a host to collect additional information about it, such as patches, CPU, and memory.

[NOTE]
====
* SmartState analysis on hosts is processed by the *Provider Operations* role. It is enabled by default.  

* For ESX or ESXi hypervisors, consider the following: ESX hosts utilize a service console for host management and can be accessed using SSH. ESXi hosts lack a service console and therefore SSH cannot be used to obtain information sets for patches, services, Linux packages, user groups, SSH Config, and FS Files. 

* `root` or administrator credentials are required to get patch information.
