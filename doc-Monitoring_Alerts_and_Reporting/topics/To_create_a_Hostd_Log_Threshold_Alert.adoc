* For *What to Evaluate*, select *Hostd Log Threshold*.
* In *Notification Frequency*, select how often you want to be notified if the log item is detected.

. In the *Hostd Log Threshold Parameters* area, select the parameters for the event log message.
  You can set a threshold for a filter, level, or message source.

  {product-title} reports on the specified level and above.
  Use *Message Source* to filter log messages based on its source.
* Set *How Far Back to Check* in days you want to look for this message.
* If you only want an alert triggered when the log message has occurred a certain number of times, type the number in *Event Count Threshold*.

. After setting the parameters, select what you want the alert to do.
  You can send an email, create an SNMP Trap, or send a management event to start an automation process.
. Click *Add*.
