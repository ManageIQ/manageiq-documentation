//Policy Profiles
//---------------

Policy profiles are groups of policies that you can assign wholesale to virtual machines, providers, clusters, hosts, and resource pools. Policy profiles provide a framework for easily managing and assigning different levels of security, across various types of cloud resources.

=== Simulating Policy

Before assigning a policy profile to a virtual machine, use the
{product-title} controls policy simulation feature to
determine if a virtual machine passes a policy profile.

=== Assigning Policy Profiles

After creating your policy profiles, you are ready to evaluate and
assign them. 

* Assign a policy profile to a virtual machine to apply the policy
profile to a specific virtual machine, independent of its related host,
provider, or repository.
* Assign a policy profile to a provider to apply the policy profile to
all virtual machines or hosts registered to that provider.
* Assign a policy profile to a cluster to apply the policy profile to
all virtual machines or hosts assigned to that cluster.
* Assign a VM policy profile to a host to apply the policy profile to
that specific host or all virtual machines registered to that Host.
* Assign a VM policy profile to a resource pool to apply the policy
profile to all virtual machines or hosts assigned to that resource pool.
