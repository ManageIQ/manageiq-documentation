.Prerequisites

* If the RHV provider has been active for a while, verify that each host has valid subscriptions and repositories by logging in using SSH and running the following commands:
+
----
# subscription-manager list --consumed
# yum repolist
----

* If a RHV host has an existing SSH private key in `/var/lib/vdsm/.ssh/id_rsa`, delete the key manually before configuring the host. Conversion host configuration does not overwrite existing keys.

. In the *Authentication* screen, click *Browse* to browse to the Manager's SSH private key or paste it in the *Conversion host SSH private key* field.
+
The Manager deploys a private SSH key on the conversion hosts in order to send commands and run playbooks. The default key file is `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/engine_id_rsa` on the Manager machine.

ifdef::rhv_1-3_vddk,rhv_1-3_ssh,osp_1-2_vddk,osp_1-2_ssh,osp_1-3_vddk,osp_1-3_ssh[]
. In the *Authentication* screen, click *Browse* to browse to the SSH private
key of the SSH key pair that you used when you created the conversion host or paste the key in the *Conversion host SSH private key* field.
+
CloudForms uses this private SSH key to connect to the conversion host.

. Select *VDDK* as the *Transformation method*.
. Enter the path of the VDDK package in the *VDDK library path* field.

ifdef::rhv_1-3_vddk,osp_1-3_vddk[]
. Set *Verify TLS Certificates* to *Yes* and click *Browse* to upload your CA certificates file.

ifdef::rhv_1-2_ssh,osp_1-2_ssh,rhv_1-3_ssh,osp_1-3_ssh[]
. Select *SSH* as the *Transformation method*.
. Click *Browse* to browse to the SSH private key you created for enabling SSH access on the VMware hypervisors or paste it in the *VMware hypervisors SSH private key field*.
endif::[]

. Click *Configure*.

. In the *Results* screen, wait for the conversion host configuration to finish and click *Close*.
+
The configured conversion hosts and status information, including error messages, appear in the *Configured Conversion Hosts* list.

If an error occurs, you can download the conversion host configuration log by clicking the *More Actions* icon (image:More_actions_icon.png[7]) and selecting *Download Log*.

You can click *Retry* if the conversion host configuration failed for reasons unconnected with your environment.

// You can click *Remove* to remove the configuration from a configured conversion host.
