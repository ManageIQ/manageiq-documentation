### Editing an Action

Edit an action to modify its properties. You can't edit any of the default actions that are supplied with {{ site.data.product.title_short }}. Only actions that you create can be changed.

**Note**: When you view an action, you can see what policies it is assigned to.

1. Browse to menu: **Control > Explorer**.

2. Click the **Actions** accordion, and then click the action that you need to edit.

3. Click ![image](../images/1847.png**)Configuration**, ![image](../images/1851.png**)Edit this Action** on the detail view of the action.

4. Make any required changes.

5. Click **Save**.

The action is modified and can be added to a policy. If the action is already party of a policy, the policy is automatically updated.
