1.  Navigate to menu:Compute\[Containers \> Providers\].

2.  Click ![Configuration](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then
    click ![Add a New Containers Provider](../images/1862.png) (**Add a
    New Containers Provider**).

3.  Enter a **Name** for the provider.

4.  From the **Type** list, select **OpenShift Container Platform**.

5.  Enter the appropriate **Zone** for the provider. If you do not
    specify a zone, it is set to `default`.

6.  From the **Alerts** list, select **Prometheus** to enable external
    alerts. Selecting **Prometheus** adds an **Alerts** tab to the lower
    pane to configure the Prometheus service. Alerts are disabled by
    default.

7.  From the **Metrics** list, select **Hawkular** or **Prometheus** to
    collect capacity and utilization data, or leave as **Disabled**.
    Selecting **Prometheus** or **Hawkular** adds a **Metrics** tab to
    the lower pane for further configuration. Metrics are disabled by
    default.

8.  In the **Default** tab, configure the following for the OpenShift
    provider:

    1.  Select a **Security Protocol** method to specify how to
        authenticate the provider:

          - **SSL**: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted
            Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider
            has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted
            Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required
            for this option.

          - **SSL trusting custom CA**: Authenticate the provider with a
            self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your
            provider’s CA certificate to the **Trusted CA
            Certificates** box in PEM format.

            <div class="note">

            You can obtain your OpenShift Container Platform provider’s
            CA certificate for all endpoints (default, metrics, alerts)
            from `/etc/origin/master/ca.crt`. Paste the output (a block
            of text starting with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`) into
            the **Trusted CA Certificates** field.

            </div>

          - **SSL without validation**: Authenticate the provider
            insecurely (not recommended).

    2.  Enter the **Hostname** (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) of the
        provider.

        <div class="important">

        The **Hostname** must use a unique fully qualified domain name.

        </div>

    3.  Enter the **API Port** of the provider. The default port is
        `8443`.

    4.  Enter a token for your provider in the **Token** box.

        <div class="note">

        To obtain a token for your provider, run the `oc get secret`
        command on your provider; see [Obtaining an OpenShift Container
        Platform Management
        Token](https://www.manageiq.org/docs/reference/latest/managing_providers/index.html#obtaining-an-openshift-container-platform-management-token).

        For example:

        \# oc get secret --namespace management-infra
        management-admin-token-8ixxs --template='{{index .data
        "ca.crt"}}' | base64 --decode

        </div>

    5.  Click **Validate** to confirm that {{ site.data.product.title }} can connect
        to the OpenShift Container Platform provider.

9.  For the **Prometheus** alerts service, add the Prometheus alerts
    endpoint in the **Alerts** tab:

    1.  Select a **Security Protocol** method to specify how to
        authenticate the service:

          - **SSL**: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted
            Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider
            has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted
            Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required
            for this option.

          - **SSL trusting custom CA**: Authenticate the provider with a
            self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your
            provider’s CA certificate to the **Trusted CA
            Certificates** box in PEM format.

          - **SSL without validation**: Authenticate the provider
            insecurely using SSL. (Not recommended)

    2.  Enter the **Hostname** (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) or alert
        **Route**.

    3.  Enter the **API Port** if your Prometheus provider uses a
        non-standard port for access. The default port is `443`.

    4.  Click **Validate** to confirm that {{ site.data.product.title_short }} can
        connect to the alerts service.

10. If you selected a metrics service, configure the service details in
    the **Metrics** tab:

    1.  Select a **Security Protocol** method to specify how to
        authenticate the service:

          - **SSL**: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted
            Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider
            has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted
            Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required
            for this option.

          - **SSL trusting custom CA**: Authenticate the provider with a
            self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your
            provider’s CA certificate to the **Trusted CA
            Certificates** box in PEM format.

            <div class="note">

            In OpenShift, the default deployment of the router generates
            certificates during installation, which can be used with the
            **SSL trusting custom CA** option. Connecting a Hawkular
            endpoint with this option requires the CA certificate that
            the cluster uses for service certificates, which is stored
            in `/etc/origin/master/service-signer.crt` on the first
            master in a cluster.

            </div>

          - **SSL without validation**: Authenticate the provider
            insecurely using SSL. (Not recommended)

    2.  Enter the **Hostname** (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) of the
        provider, or use the **Detect** button to find the hostname.

    3.  Enter the **API Port** if your Hawkular or Prometheus provider
        uses a non-standard port for access. The default port is `443`.

    4.  Click **Validate** to confirm that {{ site.data.product.title }} can connect
        to the metrics endpoint.

11. Click the **Advanced** tab to add image inspector settings for
    scanning container images on your provider using OpenSCAP.

    <div class="note">

      - These settings control downloading the image inspector container
        image from the registry and obtaining the Common Vulnerabilities
        and Exposures (CVE) information (for effective scanning) via a
        proxy.

      - CVE URL that {{ site.data.product.title_short }} requires to be open for
        OpenSCAP scanning:
        <https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/ds/>. This
        information is based on the source code of OpenSCAP.

    </div>

    1.  Enter the proxy information for the provider in either **HTTP**,
        **HTTPS**, or **NO Proxy** depending on your environment.

    2.  Enter the **Image-Inspector Repository** information. For
        example, `openshift3/image-inspector`.

    3.  Enter the **Image-Inspector Registry** information. For example,
        `registry.access.redhat.com`.

    4.  Enter the **Image-Inspector Tag** value. A tag is a mark used to
        differentiate images in a repository, typically by the
        application version stored in the image.

    5.  Enter `https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/ds/` in
        **CVE location**.

12. Click **Add**.

<div class="note">

You can also set global default image-inspector settings for all
OpenShift providers in the advanced settings menu by editing the values
under `ems_kubernetes`, instead of setting this for each provider.

For example:

    :image_inspector_registry: registry.access.redhat.com
    :image_inspector_repository: openshift3/image-inspector

</div>
