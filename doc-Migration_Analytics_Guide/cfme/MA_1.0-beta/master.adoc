Migration Analytics examines your VMware virtual machines and collects data about their operating systems and workloads, using the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms[Red Hat CloudForms] user interface. In CloudForms, you run an analysis scan on the VMware virtual machines and download the collected data as an inventory data file.

You create a report with the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/beta[Migration Analytics service], which uploads the inventory data file and analyzes it. The report provides an estimate of the initial savings in migrating to Red Hat, a detailed analysis of the VMware virtual machines, and recommendations to help you plan your migration.

Migration Analytics supports VMware version 6.0 or later.

[NOTE]
====
Migration Analytics is available as a technology preview for Red Hat CloudForms 5.0. For more information on the support scope for features marked as technology previews, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

[id='Managing-analysis-profiles_{context}']
== Managing analysis profiles

A `default` analysis profile is used for scanning your VMware virtual machines.

You can create a custom analysis profile by modifying the `custom_profile.yaml` template in xref:Custom-profile-yaml-example[].

You can export existing analysis profiles for backup, troubleshooting, or updates.

== Collecting data for Migration Analytics

You can scan your VMware virtual machines and download the results as an inventory data file to your local machine.

Optionally, you can combine multiple inventory data files into a single file in order to generate a single Migration Analytics report.
