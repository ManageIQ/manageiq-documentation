# Adding Google Compute Engine Providers

After initial installation and creation of a {{ site.data.product.title_short }}
environment, add a Google Compute Engine provider by following this
procedure.

**Prerequisites.**

To add a Google Compute Engine provider to {{ site.data.product.title_short }}, you need:

  - A Google Cloud Platform account

  - A Google Compute Engine project with the Google Compute Engine API
    enabled

  - A service account JSON key for your project

    **Note:**

    You can generate a private JSON key for your project in **IAM &
    Admin > Service Accounts** in Google Cloud Platform. This key is used
    to authenticate against your provider.

    For additional information, see the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication) documentation.

    ![1862](../images/1862.png) (**Add a New Cloud Provider**).

3.  Enter a **Name** for the provider.

4.  From the **Type** list, select **Google Compute Engine**.

5.  Select your **Preferred Region** from the list.

6.  Enter your Google Compute Engine Project ID for **Project**.

7.  Select the appropriate **Zone** if you have more than one available.
    Red Hat recommends creating a new zone for your Google Compute Engine provider.

8.  Copy your projectâ€™s **Service Account** JSON key contents to the **Service Account JSON** field.

9.  Click **Validate** to validate the credentials.

10. Click **Add**.

Make sure that NTP synchronization is enabled and working. When clocks are not synchronized, the following error will be raised:

`Credential validation was not successful: Authorization failed. Server message: { "error" : "invalid_grant", "error_description" : "Invalid JWT: Token must be a short-lived token and in a reasonable timeframe" }`
