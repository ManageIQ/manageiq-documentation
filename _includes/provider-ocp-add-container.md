1.  Browse to menu: **Compute > Containers > Providers**.

2.  Click **Configuration**, then
    click ![Add a New Containers Provider](../images/1862.png) (**Add a New Containers Provider**).

3.  Enter a **Name** for the provider.

4.  From the **Type** list, select **OpenShift Container Platform**.

5.  Enter the appropriate **Zone** for the provider. If you do not
    specify a zone, it is set to `default`.

6.  In the **Default** tab, configure the following for the OpenShift
    provider:

    1.  Select a **Security Protocol** method to specify how to
        authenticate the provider:

          - **SSL**: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted
            Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider
            has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted
            Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required
            for this option.

          - **SSL trusting custom CA**: Authenticate the provider with a
            self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your
            provider’s CA certificate to the **Trusted CA
            Certificates** box in PEM format.

            **Note:**

            You can obtain your OpenShift Container Platform provider’s
            CA certificate for all endpoints (default, metrics, alerts)
            from `/etc/origin/master/ca.crt`. Paste the output (a block
            of text starting with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`) into
            the **Trusted CA Certificates** field.

          - **SSL without validation**: Authenticate the provider
            insecurely (not recommended).

    2.  Enter the **Hostname** (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) of the provider.

        **Important:**

        The **Hostname** must use a unique fully qualified domain name.

    3.  Enter the **API Port** of the provider. The default port is
        `6443`.

    4.  Enter a token for your provider in the **Token** box.

        **Note:**

        To obtain a token for your provider, run the `oc get secret` command on your provider; see [Obtaining an OpenShift Container Platform Management Token](../managing_providers/index.html#obtaining-an-openshift-container-platform-management-token).

        For example:

        \# oc get secret --namespace management-infra
        management-admin-token-8ixxs --template='{{index .data
        "ca.crt"}}' | base64 --decode

    5.  Click **Validate** to confirm that {{ site.data.product.title_short }} can connect
        to the OpenShift Container Platform provider.

8. In the **Metrics** endpoint tab optionally configure the metrics service details:

    1.  Select a service type (e.g.: Prometheus) or leave disabled

    2.  Select a **Security Protocol** method to specify how to
        authenticate the service:

          - **SSL**: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted
            Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider
            has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted
            Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required
            for this option.

          - **SSL trusting custom CA**: Authenticate the provider with a
            self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your
            provider’s CA certificate to the **Trusted CA
            Certificates** box in PEM format.

          - **SSL without validation**: Authenticate the provider
            insecurely using SSL. (Not recommended)

    3.  Enter the **Hostname** (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) of the
        metrics service.

        In order to find the hostname you can use the `oc get route` command.

        You can retrieve the Prometheus route by running:

        `oc get route prometheus-k8s -n openshift-monitoring`

        Example:
        ```
        oc get route prometheus-k8s -n openshift-monitoring
        NAME             HOST/PORT                                            PATH             SERVICES  PORT      TERMINATION          WILDCARD
        prometheus-k8s   prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.ocp.example.com  prometheus-k8s   web       reencrypt/Redirect   None
        ```

        In this example you would use `prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.ocp.example.com` as the metrics hostname.

    4.  Enter the **API Port** of your metrics endpoint
        uses a non-standard port for access. The default port is `443`.

    5.  Click **Validate** to confirm that {{ site.data.product.title_short }} can connect
        to the metrics endpoint.

9. In the **Virtualization** endpoint tab optionally configure the virtualization service details:

    1. Select a service type (KubeVirt) or leave disabled

    2.  Select a **Security Protocol** method to specify how to
        authenticate the service:

          - **SSL**: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted
            Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider
            has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted
            Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required
            for this option.

          - **SSL trusting custom CA**: Authenticate the provider with a
            self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your
            provider’s CA certificate to the **Trusted CA
            Certificates** box in PEM format.

          - **SSL without validation**: Authenticate the provider
            insecurely using SSL. (Not recommended)

    3.  Enter the **Hostname** (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) of the
        virtualization service.

    4.  Enter the **API Port** of your virtualization service. The default port is `443`.

    5.  Enter a token for your provider in the **Token** box.

10. Click the **Advanced** tab to add image inspector settings for
    scanning container images on your provider using OpenSCAP.

    **Note:**

      - These settings control downloading the image inspector container
        image from the registry and obtaining the Common Vulnerabilities
        and Exposures (CVE) information (for effective scanning) via a
        proxy.

      - CVE URL that {{ site.data.product.title_short }} requires to be open for
        OpenSCAP scanning:
        <https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/ds/>. This
        information is based on the source code of OpenSCAP.

    1.  Enter the proxy information for the provider in either **HTTP**,
        **HTTPS**, or **NO Proxy** depending on your environment.

    2.  Enter the **Image-Inspector Repository** information. For
        example, `openshift3/image-inspector`.

    3.  Enter the **Image-Inspector Registry** information. For example,
        `registry.access.redhat.com`.

    4.  Enter the **Image-Inspector Tag** value. A tag is a mark used to
        differentiate images in a repository, typically by the
        application version stored in the image.

    5.  Enter `https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/ds/` in
        **CVE location**.

11. Click **Add**.

**Note:**

You can also set global default image-inspector settings for all
OpenShift providers in the advanced settings menu by editing the values
under `ems_kubernetes`, instead of setting this for each provider.

For example:

    :image_inspector_registry: registry.access.redhat.com
    :image_inspector_repository: openshift3/image-inspector
