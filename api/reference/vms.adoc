[[targeting-vms]]
=== Targeting VMs

These actions can be triggered on individual vm resources:

[source,data]
----
/api/vms/:id
----

As simply as POSTing the following action to a VM.

[source,json]

{
  "action" : "start"
}
----


Requests can also be made on multiple vms by targetting the primary collection:

[source,data]
----
/api/vms
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "action" : "start",
  "resources" : [
    { "href" : "http://localhost:3000/api/vms/11" },
