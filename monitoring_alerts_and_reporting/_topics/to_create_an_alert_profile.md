### Creating Alert Profiles

Alert profiles enable you to create groups of standard alerts. An alert
profile can have as many alerts assigned as you need, and can be
assigned to clusters, datastores, hosts, and virtual machines.

**Note:**

Each profile type under the **Alert Profile** accordion menu will have its own **Alert Selections** and subsequent **Assignments** choices.

2.  Click on the **Alert Profiles** accordion, then click on the type of profile that you want to create.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**),
    ![1862](../images/1862.png) (**Add a new Profile**).

4.  In the **Basic Information** box, type in a unique **Description** for the alert profile.

5.  Select the desired alerts from the **Alert Selection** area. Use the `Ctrl` key to select multiple alerts.
