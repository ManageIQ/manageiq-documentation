= Registering and Updating CloudForms Management Engine

An important part of securing Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine is to ensure your appliances use the latest packages.
Package updates to the appliance contain patches for any software bugs, including possible security bugs.

The *Red Hat Updates* page enables you to edit register and update appliances.
This includes either registering the appliance to Red Hat's Content Delivery Network (CDN) or to a Red Hat Satellite server.

The following tools are used during the update process:

* `Yum` provides package installation, updates, and dependency checking.
* `Red Hat Subscription Manager` manages subscriptions and entitlements.
* `Red Hat Satellite Server` runs at customer locations providing local system registration and updates from inside the customer's firewall.

IMPORTANT: The update worker synchronizes the VMDB with the status of available CloudForms Management Engine content every 12 hours.

NOTE: Servers with the `RHN Mirror` role also act as a repository for other Appliances to pull CloudForms Management Engine packages updates.

The *Red Hat Updates* page enables you to register appliances.
You need the following to register:

* Your Red Hat Account login or Red Hat Network Satellite login

            Attempts to register the appliance if it is not already registered. CloudForms Management Engine subscribes to the `rhel-x86_64-server-6-cf-me-3` RHN channel for RHN-registered appliances, and to the products designated by Red Hat product certification for subscription-manager registered appliances. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux channels are enabled by default on registration. In addition, CloudForms Management Engine checks for updates after registering.
|
               Apply CFME Update


|
            Applies updates to CloudForms Management Engine packages only. Specifically, this option runs the `yum -y update cfme-appliance` command. This command installs every package listed in the dependency tree if it is not already installed. If a specific version of a package is required, that version of the package is installed or upgraded. No other packages, such as PostgreSQL or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, are updated.
