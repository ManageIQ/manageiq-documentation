= Copying the VMware SSH keys to the conversion hosts

Copy the SSH public keys of the VMware hypervisors to the conversion hosts. You can collect the VMware keys either when you configure the VMware hypervisors for SSH transformation or by using `ssh-keyscan`:

* xref:Copying_collected_ssh_keys_{context}[Copying keys collected during VMware hypervisor configuration]
* xref:Copying_keys_ssh_keyscan_{context}[Copying keys collected with `ssh-keyscan`]

. Copy the VMware keys to `/var/lib/vdsm/.ssh/known_hosts` on each conversion host.

. Copy the VMware keys to `/root/.ssh/known_hosts` on each conversion host.

== Copying keys collected with `ssh-keyscan`

[CAUTION]
====
You must run `ssh-keyscan` for each VMware hypervisor. Otherwise your conversion hosts will not have all the VMware hypervisor keys and the migration will fail.
====

. Run `ssh-keyscan` for each VMware hypervisor and copy its public key to `known_hosts`, as in the following example:

[options="nowrap" subs="+quotes,verbatim"]
----
# ssh-keyscan _esx1_IP_ > /var/lib/vdsm/.ssh/known_hosts <1>
# ssh-keyscan _esx2_IP_ >> /var/lib/vdsm/.ssh/known_hosts
# ssh-keyscan _esx3_IP_ >> /var/lib/vdsm/.ssh/known_hosts
----
<1> You must use the IP address, not the host name, of the VMware hypervisor.

. Change the ownership of the `known_hosts` file to `vdsm` user and `kvm` group:

# chown 36:36 /var/lib/vdsm/.ssh/known_hosts
