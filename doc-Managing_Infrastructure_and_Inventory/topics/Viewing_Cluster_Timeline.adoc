* Use the [label]#Interval# dropdown to select hourly or daily data points.
* Use [label]#Date# to type the date for the timeline to display.
* If you select to view a daily timeline, use [label]#Show# to set how many days back to go.
  The maximum history is 31 days.
* The three [label]#Event Group# dropdowns allow the selection of different groups of events to display.
  Each has its own color.
* From the [label]#Level# dropdown, select a [label]#Summary# event if needed, or a [label]#Detail# list of events.
  For example, the detail level of a [label]#Power On# event might include the power on request, the starting event, and the actual [label]#Power On# event.
  If you select [label]#Summary#, the timeline only displays the Power On event.
