= Configuring Federated Authentication with SAML
//= original title: External Authentication Using SAML

This procedure outlines how to manually configure an appliance to use SAML for federation authentication. 

To enable external authentication using SAML, complete the following steps to configure your HTTP server, then your {product-title_short} appliance.

[NOTE]
====
The current SAML implementation only secures the {product-title_short} appliance’s web user interface with SAML. The REST API and self service user interface do not currently support SAML.
====

.SAML Requirements

The following is required in order to enable SAML authentication to the appliance:

* A {product-title_short} appliance
* A SAML identity provider (e.g. Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.0 or later)

== Configuring Authentication with SAML and Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO)

While other SAML identity providers can be used with {product-title_short}, this example procedure covers using Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) 7.0, which is implemented using the Apache HTTP server's `mod_auth_mellon` module.

[NOTE]
====
For more information about Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO), see the https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on[Red Hat Single Sign-On documentation].

[[configure-apache-SAML]]
=== Configuring the HTTP Server for SAML Authentication with Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO)

The Apache HTTP server first must be configured to work with SAML authentication. All SAML-related certificates and keys are accessed from `/etc/httpd/saml2/`.

. Log into the {product-title_short} appliance as root using SSH, and create the `/etc/httpd/saml2/` directory:
+
------
# mkdir -p /etc/httpd/saml2
------
+
. Copy the `httpd` remote user and SAML template configuration files to the appliance:
+
------
# TEMPLATE_DIR="/opt/rh/cfme-appliance/TEMPLATE"
# cp ${TEMPLATE_DIR}/etc/httpd/conf.d/manageiq-remote-user.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/
# cp ${TEMPLATE_DIR}/etc/httpd/conf.d/manageiq-external-auth-saml.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/
------
+
[NOTE]
====
The following are notable SAML configuration defaults in the `manageiq-external-auth-saml.conf` file:

* Identity Provider Files (i.e. Red Hat SSO)
** Metadata File: `/etc/httpd/saml2/idp-metadata.xml`

* Service Provider Files (i.e. `mod_auth_mellon`)
** Private Key File: `/etc/httpd/saml2/miqsp-key.key`
** Certificate File: `/etc/httpd/saml2/miqsp-cert.cert`
** Metadata File: `/etc/httpd/saml2/miqsp-metadata.xml`

Other `mod_auth_mellon` parameters, such as endpoints and protected URLs, must not be modified as the appliance expects them to be defined as such.
====
+
. Generate the service provider files on the appliance using the Apache HTTP server's `mod_auth_mellon` command `mellon_create_metadata.sh`:
+
----
# cd /etc/httpd/saml2
# /usr/libexec/mod_auth_mellon/mellon_create_metadata.sh https://<miq-appliance> https://<miq-appliance>/saml2
----
+
The `mellon_create_metadata.sh` script creates file names based on the appliance URL.
+
[NOTE]
====
If your appliance is behind a load balancer or uses a virtual IP address, use the hostname associated with the VIP. For example:
`# /usr/libexec/mod_auth_mellon/mellon_create_metadata.sh https://my-haproxy-ka https://my-haproxy-ka/saml2`
====
+
. Rename the files created by the `mellon_create_metadata.sh` script to match the expected file names from the `manageiq-external-auth-saml.conf` file:
+
----
# mv https_<miq-appliance>.key  miqsp-key.key
# mv https_<miq-appliance>.cert miqsp-cert.cert
# mv https_<miq-appliance>.xml  miqsp-metadata.xml
----
+
. Now that the service provider's `metadata.xml` file has been generated, the service provider definition can be defined in the SAML identity provider.
For Red Hat SSO, a realm can be created for one or more appliances with individual clients defined one per appliance, where the client ID is specified as the URL of the appliance.
+
To add a client in the Red Hat SSO {product-title_short} realm:
+
.. Select and import the `miqsp-metadata.xml` file created for `mod_auth_mellon`.
.. Set the client ID as `https://<miq-appliance>`.
.. Set the client protocol as `saml`.
+
. Update the client definition for the appliance in Red Hat SSO with the following:
+
[options="header"]
|=========================================================================================
| Setting                                     | Value
| Name ID Format                              | username
| Valid Redirect URIs                         | https://<miq-appliance>/saml2/postResponse
| Assertion Consumer Service POST Binding URL | https://<miq-appliance>/saml2/postResponse
| Logout Service Redirect Binding URL         | https://<miq-appliance>/saml2/logout
|=========================================================================================
+
. Obtain the identity provider’s `idp-metadata.xml` metadata file as follows:
+
----
# cd /etc/httpd/saml2
# curl -s -o idp-metadata.xml \
  http://<redhatSSO-server>:8080/auth/realms/<miq-realm>/protocol/saml/descriptor
----
+
. In {product-title_short}, the following change is necessary to the `idp-metadata.xml` file for SAML logout to work between `mod_auth_mellon` and Red Hat SSO:
+
----
# vi idp-metadata.xml

  ...
  <SingleLogoutService
<   Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
---
>   Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect"
    Location=
  ...
----
+
. Restart the HTTP server on the appliance:
+
----
# systemctl restart httpd
----


[[configure-appliance-UI-SAML]]
=== Configuring SAML Authentication in the {product-title_short} User Interface

After configuring the HTTP server for SAML, update the {product-title_short} appliance so that user interface can be accessed using SAML authentication.

. Click image:config-gear.png[] (*Configuration*). 
. Select your server in the *Settings* accordion.
. Select the *Authentication* tab.
. Select a *Session Timeout* to set the period of inactivity before a user is logged out of the console.
. Set the mode to *External (httpd)*.
. Check *Enable SAML*. This enables the SAML login button on the appliance login screen, then redirects to the SAML protected page for authentication, and supports the SAML logout process.
. Check *Enable Single Sign-On*. With this option enabled, initial access to the appliance's user interface redirects to the SAML identity provider authentication screen. Logging out from the appliance returns the user to the appliance login screen, allowing them to log in as `admin` unless *Disable Local Login* is also checked.
. Optional: Check *Disable Local Login* to disable the `admin` login to appliance and only allow SAML based authentication. Note that if there are issues with the identity provider or you require `admin` access to the appliance, you cannot log in through the appliance login screen until you re-enable local login as described in xref:re-enable-local-login[].
. Check *Get User Groups from External Authentication (httpd)*.
. Click *Save*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure the user’s groups are created on the appliance and appropriate roles are assigned to those groups. See _SAML Assertions_ in xref:saml-assertions[] for more information on the parameters used by the {product-title_short} appliance.

For example, to configure user groups from your SAML identity provider to work with {product-title_short}:

  . In your SAML identity provider, specify your existing user groups in similar format to the following: `REMOTE_USER_GROUPS=Administrators;CloudAdministrators;Users`
  . On your {product-title_short} appliance, create the equivalent groups. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/general_configuration/#creating-a-user-group[Creating a User Group] in _General Configuration_.
  . On your {product-title_short} appliance, assign EVM roles to the groups. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/general_configuration/#creating-a-role[Creating a Role] in _General Configuration_.
====

Complete the above steps on each appliance in the settings menu, then navigate to menu:Configuration[Access Control].

You can now log into your {product-title_short} appliance using your SAML credentials.

[[saml-assertions]]
== SAML Assertions

To authenticate to the {product-title_short} appliance using SAML, the following remote user parameters are looked at by the appliance upon a successful login and redirect from the identity provider. These parameters are used by the appliance to obtain group authentication information.


[options="header",cols="<2,<1",width="70%"]
|==============================================
| HTTP Environment           | SAML Assertion
| REMOTE_USER                | username
| REMOTE_USER_EMAIL          | email
| REMOTE_USER_FIRSTNAME      | firstname
| REMOTE_USER_LASTNAME       | lastname
| REMOTE_USER_FULLNAME       | fullname
| REMOTE_USER_GROUPS         | groups
|==============================================

For Red Hat SSO, the above SAML assertions can be defined for the appliance client in Red Hat SSO as mappers.

[options="header",cols="<1,<2,<1,<1"]
|============================================================================
| Name       | Category                  | Type           | Property
| username   | AttributeStatement Mapper | User Property  | username
| email      | AttributeStatement Mapper | User Property  | email
| firstname  | AttributeStatement Mapper | User Property  | firstName
| lastname   | AttributeStatement Mapper | User Property  | lastName
| fullname   | AttributeStatement Mapper | User Attribute | fullName
| groups     | Group Mapper              | Group List     | groups
|============================================================================

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `fullName` attribute was not available in the default database as of this writing and was added as a user attribute.

[[re-enable-local-login]]
== Re-enabling Local Login _(Optional)_

If you disabled local login in the {product-title_short} user interface but need the ability to log in as `admin`, you can re-enable local login using one of the following methods:

.Re-enabling Local Login from the Appliance User Interface

This method requires the identity provider to be available, and the ability to log in as a user with enough administrative privileges to update {product-title_short} authentication settings.

. Log in to the appliance user interface as the administrative user.
. From the settings menu, select menu:Configuration[Authentication].
. Uncheck *Disable Local Login*.
. Click *Save*.

.Re-enabling Local Login from the Appliance Console:

. Use SSH to log into the appliance as `root`.
. Run the `appliance_console` command.
. Select *Update External Authentication Options*.
. Select *Enable Local Login*.
. Apply the updates.

Alternatively, log into the appliance as root using SSH, and run the following command:

----
# appliance_console_cli --extauth-opts local_login_disabled=false
----
