= Host Virtual Summary

Clicking on a specific host shows the Host's Virtual Thumbnail and an `operating system-sensitive` screen of host information, called the Host Summary.
Where applicable, click on a subcategory of the Host Summary to see more detail on that section.

A *Refresh* provides some basic information on the Host.
To get more detail, enter credentials for the host and perform a SmartState Analysis.

The Summary divides into the following categories.

  Some categories can be clicked on for additional detail.
