= Installing and configuring Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 or 14

. Install Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 or 14. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform Director Installation and Usage 13] or link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform Director Installation and Usage 14].

. Create provider networks for the target instances to preserve the IP addresses of the source virtual machines. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/networking_guide/#create_a_network[Create a network] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Networking Guide_.

. Create a project for the conversion hosts and whatever destination projects you require for the target instances. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/users_and_identity_management_guide/#create_a_project[Create a Project] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Users and Identity Management Guide_.

. Ensure that the `admin` user has `member` and `admin` roles in the conversion and destination projects. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/users_and_identity_management_guide/#edit_a_project[Edit a Project] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Users and Identity Management Guide_.

. Set at least one volume type for the target block storage. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/storage_guide/#section-create-volume[Create a Volume] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/storage_guide/#section-volume-retype[Changing a Volumeâ€™s Type (Volume Re-typing)] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Storage Guide_. Otherwise, CloudForms cannot detect the storage when you create the infrastructure mapping.

. Ensure that the storage backends have sufficient space for the migrated virtual machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using Red Hat Ceph Storage, you will require three times the space of the source virtual machines for the migrated virtual machines. A Ceph storage cluster, by default, creates two copies of an object in a replicated storage pool, for a total of three copies. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/3/html-single/architecture_guide/index#concept-arch-data-copies-arch[Data Copies] in the _Red Hat Ceph Storage Architecture Guide_.

The migrated disks use all of the space because it is preallocated. For example, a source virtual machine with a 100 GB disk requires 300 GB of storage, regardless of how much data the disk actually contains. To save storage space, you can use the `fstrim` command on the migrated virtual machines as a postmigration task or playbook.
====

. Configure security groups with the following ports enabled:

* For the conversion hosts and CloudForms: port 22 (SSH)
* For CloudForms: port 443 (HTTPS)
+
[NOTE]
====
Outbound traffic is enabled by default. If you have changed this setting, enable ports 902 (CloudForms to VMware) and 5480 (conversion hosts to vCenter).
====

. Create flavors for the source virtual machines. If you do not create custom flavors, CloudForms will try to map each source virtual machine to an existing flavor.

. Ensure that the event monitor workers are running. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html/general_configuration/configuration#server-diagnostics[Server Diagnostics] in _Red Hat CloudForms General Configuration_.
