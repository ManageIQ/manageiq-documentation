	<para>
		When provisioning a service, input will be needed from the requester. <guilabel>Service Dialogs</guilabel> are used to take input from the user. This input is connected to a method in the <guilabel>Automate</guilabel> model that defines how the users input is translated into the provision request. Before creating a <guilabel>Service Dialog</guilabel>, be sure to plan what items you need the user to input.
