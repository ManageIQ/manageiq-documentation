= Enabling Google Compute Engine Events

After adding Google Compute Engine as a provider in {product-title}, enable events for the provider so that you can monitor the system from {product-title}.

Events are set up on a per-project basis by using Google Stackdriver logging combined with Google Pub/Sub. Stackdriver logging is a service that aggregates and exposes log events from Google services and applications. Stackdriver exports the log events to Google Pub/Sub, a messaging service. This section describes how to export activity log entries for a Google Compute Engine project so that events are captured in {product-title}.


[[GCE_event_prerequisites]]
.Prerequisites for Exporting Google Compute Engine Events
- You must have owner permission on the project you are exporting.
- The Google Cloud Pub/Sub API must be enabled for your project. To enable the API:
--
  . In Google Cloud Platform, select your project from the top menu bar.
  . Click image:GCE-products-services.png[] to show the *Products and Services* menu. Click *API Manager* to go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/.
  . In the API Manager *Overview* tab, search for `Pub/Sub` in the *Google APIs* search bar and select *Google Cloud Pub/Sub API* from the results. Click the *Enable* button.
  . If Google Cloud Pub/Sub API is already enabled, the *Enable* button will not show, and instead *Google Cloud Pub/Sub API* will be listed under *Enabled APIs*.
--
- The Stackdriver logging service must have permission to publish to your project’s Pub/Sub service. To add the required permissions:
--
  . In Google Cloud Platform, select your project and navigate to image:GCE-products-services.png[] menu:Products and Services[IAM & Admin > IAM] to go to https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam/.
  . Assign *Logs Configuration Writer* permissions to your project:
    .. If the `cloud-logs@system.gserviceaccount.com` account is already listed under *Members*, ensure *Logs Configuration Writer* is selected under *Role(s)*.
    .. If the `cloud-logs@system.gserviceaccount.com` account is not listed under *Members*:
      ... Click *Add* to add the permissions.
      ... In the dialog box, enter `cloud-logs@system.gserviceaccount.com` in *Members* to add the Google APIs service account to the permissions list. 
      ... In the *Select a Role* dropdown, select menu:Logging[Logs Configuration Writer] and click *Add*.

== Configuring Google Compute Engine to Export Events

After you have completed the steps from xref:GCE_event_prerequisites[], set up your Google Compute Engine project to export events to {product-title} with the following steps:

. In Google Cloud Platform, click image:GCE-products-services.png[] to show the *Products and Services* menu, and click *Logging* to go to  https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/.
. Select your project from the top menu bar.
. Click *Exports* from the *Logging* menu.
. In the *Select service* list, select *Compute Engine*.
. Under *Export these sources*, click *Add item*, and select `compute.googleapis.com/activity_log` from the list.
. Under *Select export destinations*, click the *Publish to Cloud Pub/Sub topic* dropdown and click *Add new topic...*
. In the *Create Cloud Pub/Sub Topic* dialog, enter `manageiq-activity-log` as the *Name*. Click *Create*.

. Click *Save*.

When changes occur to Google Compute Engine instances, {product-title} is now notified and reports these changes as events.
