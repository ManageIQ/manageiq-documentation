	<title>Changes in the Core Set of Ruby Gems</title> 
				<para>
					Users of Red Hat CloudForms can construct custom automation methods in Ruby to extend the product. Red Hat CloudForms ships with a core set of Ruby gems used by the CloudForms Management Engine Rails Application. The Ruby gems in this set are subject to change, and have changed since CloudForms 3.1 (CloudForms Management Engine 5.3). If you are calling gems using Automate that are no longer in the CloudForms Management Engine Appliance, you can install them by using the <command>gem install</command> command. 
				</para>
				<para>
					While gems can be imported into automation methods using <code>require</code>, it is recommended that the authors of the automation methods clearly document the use of gems either in the core set or a custom set. It is the responsibility of the author of such custom automation to own the life cycle of any gem being referenced in those methods.
