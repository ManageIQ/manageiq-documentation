= Adding Azure Providers

CloudForms Management Engine now supports Microsoft Azure providers. When adding an Azure provider, select a region from a list of possible regions; one provider will be created for the selected region.
You can discover a set of Azure providers across all regions.

NOTE: Before Red Hat CloudForms can be authenticated to Microsoft Azure, a series of steps must be followed on Azure to create a service principal account for CloudForms; see https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/[Create Active Directory application and service principal account using the Azure portal].

After a service principal account has been created in Azure, the following three pieces of information will be available for adding an Azure provider to CloudForms:

* Client ID
* Tenant ID
* Client Key

To Add an Azure Provider:

. Navigate to menu:Clouds[Providers].
. Click image:images/1847.png[] (*Configuration*), then click image:images/1848.png[] (*Add a New Cloud Provider*).
