= Removing a Provider

If a provider has been decommissioned or requires some troubleshooting, it might require deletion from the VMDB. 

Deleting a provider removes the account information from CloudForms Management Engine console.
You will no longer be able to view any associated history including chargeback reports generated for the deleted provider.
Additionally, if CloudForms Management Engine is the database of record, deleting providers would become a major problem for the other systems relying on it for accurate and consistent billing information.
Review all the dependencies carefully before deleting a provider.
