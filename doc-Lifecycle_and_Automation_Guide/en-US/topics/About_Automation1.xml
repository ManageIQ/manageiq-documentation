				Intelligent Workload Management - An enterprise had a requirement that when a virtual machine has reached a High CPU Percent Ready for a specified period of time, a vMotion should occur to a more suitable host. For this reason, VMware's Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) was not practical, as the CPU Ready metric could not trigger DRS. The solution was to leverage CloudForms Management Engine Control and CloudForms Management Engine Automate to drive the management of this workflow.
