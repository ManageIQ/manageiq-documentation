. On the *Request* tab, enter information about this provisioning request. In *Request Information*, type in at least a first and last name and an email address. This email is used to send the requester status emails during the provisioning process for items such as auto-approval, quota, provision complete, retirement, request pending approval, and request denied. The other information is optional. If the {product-title} Server is configured to use LDAP, you can use the *Look Up* button to populate the other fields based on the email address.

.. Fill in the *Volume Name* and *Size (gigabytes)* fields.
.. If you want the volume to be deleted once the instance terminates (thereby making it non-persistent), check *Delete on Instance Terminate*.
.. To provision and add multiple volumes to the instance, click *Add Volume*. Doing so will add new fields you can fill in.

. Click *Submit*.

The provisioning request is sent for approval. For the provisioning to begin, a user with the admin, approver, or super admin account role must approve the request. The admin and super admin roles can also edit, delete, and deny the requests. You will be able to see all provisioning requests where you are either the requester or the approver.

After submission, the appliance assigns each provision request a *Request ID*. If an error occurs during the approval or provisioning process, use this ID to locate the request in the appliance logs. The Request ID consists of the region associated with the request followed by the request number. As regions define a range of one trillion database IDs, this number can be several digits long.

*Request ID Format*

Request 99 in region 123 results in Request ID 123000000000099.
