[[settings]]
=== Settings

The options under the *Settings* area provide a hierarchical view of options that allow you to configure global options for the infrastructure of your {product-title} environment. At the top level, you have *Settings* including users, LDAP Groups, account roles, capacity and utilization collection, tag categories, values, and imports, custom variable imports, and license uploads. When you click on *Settings* and expand it, you can configure *Analysis Profiles*, *Zones*, and *Schedules*.

When you go the *Settings* accordion, you are automatically taken to the server list under *Zones*.

[[regions]]
==== Regions

Use *Regions* for centralizing data which is collected from public and private virtualization environments. A region is ultimately represented as a single database for the VMDB. Regions are particularly useful when multiple geographical locations need to be managed as they enable all the data collection to happen at each particular location and avoid data collection traffic across slow links between networks.

When multiple regions are being used, each with their own unique ID, a master region can be created to centralize the data of all the children regions into a single master database. To do this, configure each child region to replicate its data to the master region database (Red Hat recommends use of region 99). This parent and child region is a one-to-many relationship.

Regions can contain multiple zones, which in turn contain appliances. Zones are used for further segregating network traffic along with enabling failover configurations. Each appliance has the capability to be configured for a number of specialized server roles. These roles are limited to the zone containing the appliance they run on.

Only one failover type of each server role can run in a zone. If multiple appliances have the same failover role, the extras are used as backups that activate only if the primary appliance fails. Non-failover server roles can run on multiple appliances simultaneously in a zone, so resources can be adjusted according to the workload those roles are responsible for.

The following diagram demonstrates an example of the multiple regions working together in a {product-title} environment.

image:7151.png[]

The Master appliance is located in Chicago and contains a master region and a subregion that manages the worker appliances. The Mahwah technology center contains a single subregion that manages two zones. Likewise the San Diego technology center contains a single subregion managing a single zone.

[NOTE]
======
* Replicating a parent region to a higher-level parent is not supported.
* Parent regions can be configured after the child regions are online.
======

The following diagram provides a closer look at a region:
image:7150.png[]

In this region, we have several {product-title} appliances acting as UI nodes and worker nodes. These worker nodes execute tasks on the providers in your environment. The Region also uses a region database that reports to a master database on the main {product-title} appliance. All appliances can connect to the authentication services (Active Directory, LDAP, Identity Management), outgoing mail (SMTP), and network services (SNMP).

[[region-scope]]
===== Region Scope

Regions are used to consolidate data from multiple VMDBs to a central database. The database at the top level, the master VMDB, cannot be used for operational tasks such as SmartState Analysis or Capacity and Utilization data collection. It is intended for use as a reporting database that includes all information across multiple subordinate regions. The subordinate regions replicate their information to the master.

[NOTE]
======
The subordinate regions are not aware of each other from a database perspective. You cannot see information from one subordinate region in another. The only VMDB with data visibility to all subordinate regions is the top level.
======

*Master Regions Scope*

* Reports all information from all subordinate VMDBs reporting up to it.
* Can perform power operations on virtual machines from subordinate regions.
* Controls its own access control list.

*Subordinate Regions Scope*

* Each subordinate controls its own access control independent of the other regions.
* Can only do work (such as SmartState Analysis and Capacity and Utilization collection) in its own region.
* Has no knowledge of the other regions.
* Replicates its data up to the master region.

[[region-settings]]
===== Region Settings

In the *Region* area, set items that apply to your entire {product-title} infrastructure such as users, LDAP Groups, capacity and utilization collection, company tags and tag categories, and licensing.
Regions are also used for database replication.

[[capacity-and-utilization-collections]]
===== Capacity and Utilization Collections

[[capacity-and-utilization-collection-settings]]
====== Capacity and Utilization Collection Settings

Use *C & U Collection Settings* to select specifically which clusters and datastores you want to collect usage data for. By selecting a cluster, you are choosing to collect data for all hosts and virtual machines that are part of that cluster. You must also have a server with the Capacity & Utilization *Coordinator*, *Data Collector*, and *Data Processor* roles enabled as well. See Section *Server Control Settings*.

After a provider has been discovered and its relationships refreshed, view the clusters, hosts, and datastores from the settings menu. Navigate to *Configuration*, then click on the menu:Settings[Region > C & U Collection] tab.

[[enabling-a-cluster,-host,-or-datastore-for-capacity-and-utilization-collection]]
====== Enabling a Cluster, Host, or Datastore for Capacity and Utilization Collection

. In the *Datastores* area, check all datastores that you want to collect data for.
. Click *Save*.


[NOTE]
=========================
. As new clusters, hosts, and datastores are discovered, you will need to come back to this configuration to enable collection of capacity and utilization data unless you have used the *Collect for All* check boxes.
. *Collect for All Clusters* must be checked to be able to collect capacity and utilization data from cloud providers such as Red Hat OpenStack Platform or Amazon EC2.
=========================

[[tags]]
===== Tags

[[company-tag-categories-and-tags]]
====== Company Tag Categories and Tags

{product-title} allows you to create your own set of tags and tag categories. Use tags to create a customized, searchable index for your resources. Depending on your database type, your tags may be case sensitive. After creating these values, you can apply them to your resources. There are two kinds of tags.

* *Company tags* which you will see under *My Company Tags* for a resource. Create company tags from the settings menu. Navigate to *Configuration*, then click the *Settings* accordion, then menu:Region[My Company Tags]. A selection of company tags is provided to you by default as samples. These can be deleted if you do not need them, but are not recreated by {product-title}.

[[zones]]
==== Zones

You can organize your {product-title} Infrastructure into zones to configure failover and isolate traffic. A provider that is discovered by a server in a specific zone gets monitored and managed in that zone.
All jobs, such as a SmartState Analysis or VM power operation, dispatched by a server in a specific zone can get processed by any {product-title} appliance assigned to that same zone.

Zones can be created based on your own environment. You can make zones based on geographic location, network location, or function. When first started, a new server is put into the default zone.

Suppose you have four {product-title} appliances with two in the East zone, appliances A and B, and two in the West zone, appliances C and D. VC East is discovered by one of the {product-title} appliances in the {product-title} Eastern zone.
If Appliance A dispatches a job of analyzing twenty virtual machines, this job can be processed by either Appliance A or B, but not C or D.

[[ldap_settings]]
====== Configuring LDAP Authentication

If you choose LDAP or LDAPS as your authentication mode, the required parameters are exposed under *LDAP Settings*. Be sure to validate your settings before saving them.

To configure {product-title_short} to use LDAP for authentication, complete the following steps:

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*. Select the *Authentication* tab.
. Select a *Session Timeout* to set the period of inactivity before a user is logged out of the console.
. Select *LDAP* or *LDAPS* from the *Mode* list. This exposes additional required parameters under *LDAP Settings*.
. Configure your *LDAP Settings* (the following example configures a Red Hat Identity Management LDAP server):
* Use *LDAP Host Names* to specify the fully qualified domain names of your LDAP servers. {product-title_short} will search each host name in order until it finds one that authenticates the user. Note, {product-title_short} supports using a maximum of 3 possible *LDAP Host Names*.
* Use *LDAP Port* to specify the port for your LDAP server. The default is 389 for LDAP and 636 for LDAPS.
* From the *User Type* list, select *User Principal Name* to type the user name in the format of user@domainname. Select *Email Address* to login with the users email address.
Select *Distinguished Name* (CN=<user>) or *Distinguished Name* (UID=<user>) to use just the user name, but be sure to enter the proper *User Suffix* for either one. Choose the correct *Distinguished Name* option for your directory service implementation.
* Specify the *User Suffix*, such as acme.com for *User Principal Name* or cn=users,dc=acme,dc=com for *Distinguished Name*, in *Base DN*.
* From the *User Type* list, select one of the following and configure the values for your LDAP server:
** *User Principal Name*: Type the user name in the format of user@domainname, for example, `dbright@acme.com`. (In this case, the user would log on as `dbright`.)
** *Email Address*: Logs in with the user's email address.
** *Distinguished Name* (CN=<user>): Uses the common name for the user. Be sure to enter the correct *User Suffix* and *Distinguished Name* option for your directory service implementation: for example, `cn=dan bright,ou=users,dc=acme,dc=com`. (The user logs on as `dan bright`.)
** *Distinguished Name* (UID=<user>): Uses the user ID (UID). Be sure to enter the correct *User Suffix* and *Distinguished Name* option for your directory service implementation: for example, `uid=dan bright,ou=users,dc=acme,dc=com`. (The user logs on as `dan bright`.)
** *SAM Account Name*: User logon for Active Directory clients and servers using legacy Windows versions.
* Specify the *User Suffix*, such as `acme.com` for *User Principal Name* or `cn=users,dc=acme,dc=com` for *Distinguished Name*, in *Base DN*.
+
[NOTE]
======
The `ldapsearch(1)` command can be used to get details of your LDAP settings. To get details related to a specific user, run:

  # ldapsearch -D "cn=directory manager" -H ldap://www.acme.com:389 -b "dc=acme,dc=com" -s sub "(objectclass=*)" -w password | grep -i dbright

To search for your LDAP server's distinguished name (DN) values, run:

  # ldapsearch -D "cn=directory manager" -H ldap://www.acme.com:389 -b "dc=acme,dc=com" -s sub "(objectclass=*)" -w password
======
+
.Example: LDAP Configuration
image:LDAP-authentication-full.png[]
+
. Configure your *Role Settings*:
In both LDAP and LDAPS, you can use groups from your directory service to set the role for the authenticated LDAP user. The LDAP user must be assigned one of the account role groups. See xref:assigning_account_roles_using_ldap_groups[] for more information.
* For LDAP users not belonging to a group:
** Select a {product-title_short} group from the *Default Group for Users* list. This default group can be used for all LDAP users who use LDAP for authentication only. Do not select *Get User Groups from LDAP*, which will hide the *Default Group for Users* option.
* For LDAP users belonging to a group:
** Check *Get User Groups from LDAP* to retrieve the user's group membership from LDAP. This is used for mapping a user's authorization to a {product-title_short} role. This requires group names on the LDAP server to match {product-title_short} group names.
+
[IMPORTANT]
======
If you do not check *Get User Groups from LDAP*, the user must be defined in the VMDB using the console where the User ID is the same as the user's name in your directory service typed in lowercase.
======
** Check *Get Roles from Home Forest* to use the LDAP roles from the LDAP user's home forest. This will allow you to discover groups on your LDAP server and create {product-title_short} groups based on your LDAP server's group names. Any user logging in will be assigned to that group. This option is only displayed when *Get User Groups from LDAP* is checked.
** Check *Follow Referrals* to look up and bind a user that exists in a domain other than the one configured in the LDAP authentication settings.
** Specify the user name to bind to the LDAP server in *Bind DN*. This user must have read access to all users and groups that will be used for {product-title_short} authentication and role assignment, for example , a service account user with access to all LDAP users.
** Enter the password for the Bind DN user in *Bind Password*.
+
. Click *Validate* to verify your settings.
. Click *Save*.

LDAP authentication is now configured in your CloudForms environment.

To assign account roles using LDAP groups, see xref:assigning_account_roles_using_ldap_groups[].


[[trusted-forests]]
====== Trusted Forests

Optionally, if a user has group memberships in another LDAP forest, specify the settings to access the memberships in the trusted forest.

When trusted forests are added to the authentication configuration, they are used only for finding groups that a user is a member of. {product-title_short} will first collect all of the user's groups from the primary LDAP directory. Then it will collect any additional groups that the user is a member of from all of the configured forests.

The collected LDAP groups are used to match, by name, against the groups defined in {product-title_short}. The user must be a member of at least one matching LDAP group to be successfully authenticated.

To add settings for a trusted forest:

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*.
. Click the *Settings* accordion, then click *Zones*.
. Click the *Zone* where the server is located.
. Click the *Server*.
. Click the *Authentication* tab.
. Check *Get User Groups from LDAP*, and enter all items in the *Role Settings* area.
. In the *Trusted Forest Settings* area, click image:green-plus.png[](*Click to add a new forest*).
. Enter the *LDAP Host Name*, select a *Mode*, and enter an *LDAP Port*, *Base DN*, *Bind DN*, and *Bind Password*.
. Click *Save*.

After adding other trusted LDAP forests, you can then change the order in which {product-title_short} looks up the forests for authentication. For instructions, see xref:ldap_lookup_priority[].


[[assigning_account_roles_using_ldap_groups]]
====== Assigning {product-title_short} Account Roles Using LDAP Groups

After configuring LDAP authentication as described in xref:ldap_settings[], you can associate {product-title_short} account roles with your LDAP users. The LDAP server defines the groups and users for {product-title_short}, while {product-title_short} defines the account roles, and maps the roles to the privileges the LDAP user has.

There are two ways to associate your LDAP groups with {product-title_short} account roles:

* Create groups in {product-title_short} that match your existing LDAP groups by name, and assign the groups account roles; or
* Create groups on your LDAP server based on the default account roles in {product-title_short}.

The users in your LDAP groups then inherit the {product-title_short} account roles for the LDAP group(s) they are in.

The authentication process then happens as such:

. `LDAPuser1` attempts to log into {product-title_short}, so {product-title_short} queries the LDAP server to verify it knows `LDAPuser1`.
. The LDAP server then confirms that it knows `LDAPuser1`, and provides information about the LDAP groups `LDAPuser1` belongs to: `Group1`.
. {product-title_short} then looks up `Group1`, and discovers that `Group1` is associated with `Role1`.
. {product-title_short} then associates `LDAPuser1` with `Group1` in {product-title_short}, and then allows the user to perform tasks allowable by that role.


====== Using Existing LDAP Groups to Assign Account Roles

This section provides instructions for mapping your existing LDAP groups to account roles in {product-title_short}. As a result, the users in the LDAP group will then be assigned to the CFME roles associated with that group.

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*.
. Click the *Access Control* accordion, then click *Groups*.
. Click image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and image:plus_green.png[] (*Add a new Group*) to create a group.
. There are two ways to specify the group to use:
* In the *Description* field, enter the (common name (`cn`) for your existing LDAP group assigned to users requiring access to {product-title_short}.
*  Select *Look Up LDAP Groups* to find a list of groups assigned to a specific user in LDAP, then use the *LDAP Group for User* list to choose a group.
.. In *User to Look Up*, enter the common name (`cn`) for a user in your LDAP group.
.. Enter the *Username*.
.. In *Password*, enter the user's password. Click *Retrieve*.
. Select a *Role* to map to the group.
. Select a *Project/Tenant* to map to the group.
+
image:Assign_LDAP-Roles.png[]
+
. Select any filters to apply to what this group can view in the *Assign Filters* area:
.. In the *My Company Tags* tab, select tags to limit the user to items containing those tags. The items that have changed show in a blue italicized font.
.. In the *Host & Clusters* tab, select the host and clusters to limit the user to. The items that have changed show in a blue italicized font.
image:2093.png[]
.. In the *VMs & Templates* tab, select the folders created in your virtual infrastructure to limit the user to. The items that have changed show in a blue italicized font.
. Click *Add*.

To configure the LDAP group lookup priority, see xref:ldap_lookup_priority[].


====== Using Groups Named by {product-title_short} to Assign Account Roles

You can also configure access control for LDAP users by creating groups on your LDAP server based on {product-title_short} account roles.

Your LDAP group names must match the account role names in {product-title_short}. The LDAP users in that group are then automatically assigned to that specific account role.

. In your LDAP directory service, define a distribution group for one or more of the account roles with the names shown in the table below.
This group must be in the LDAP directory source you specified for the server. See xref:ldap_settings[].
+
.Account Role and Directory Service Group Names

. Make each user of your directory service that you want to have access to {product-title_short} a member of one of these groups.
. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*.
. Click the *Settings* accordion, then select your server under *Zones*.
. Click the *Authentication* tab and enable *Get User Groups from LDAP* after typing in all of the required LDAP authentication settings. See xref:ldap_settings[].


[[ldap_lookup_priority]]
====== Configuring Lookup Priority for LDAP Groups

{product-title_short} can have multiple LDAP groups configured, which the appliance will attempt to authenticate with one by one until it succeeds. The lookup priority of these groups can be rearranged; to configure the order in which {product-title_short} looks up LDAP groups:

[NOTE]
====
On initial login, a user's _current group_ assignment is the highest priority group. User group membership, on subsequent logins, is set as the last assigned group from the prior session.
====

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*.
. Click on the *Access Control* accordion, then click *Groups*.
. Click image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and image:plus_green.png[] (*Edit Sequence of User Groups for LDAP Look Up*) to prioritize which group a user will default to if LDAP returns multiple matching groups.
. Select one or more consecutive groups and use the arrow buttons to move the user group higher or lower in priority.
. Click *Save*.

====== Testing LDAP Configuration

To test that your LDAP or LDAPS group configuration is working correctly with {product-title_short}:

. Log out of the {product-title_short} user interface.
. Log back in as an LDAP user that is assigned to one or more of the matching groups.
. Change groups by clicking on the user dropdown menu on the top right of the user interface. The dropdown list will show the groups the user is authorized for.

You can also check the logs in `/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/audit.log` or `/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/evm.log` to verify your LDAP configuration is working correctly.

First, run the following command in a terminal to view the log messages in real time:

  tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/audit.log

Then log into the CloudForms user interface as an LDAP user, while checking `/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/audit.log` for updated status, success, or failure messages. Alternatively, you can test your LDAP configuration by viewing the logs in `/var/www/miq/vmdb/log/evm.log` with `grep`, which are more verbose.


.Troubleshooting LDAP configuration

To test a problematic {product-title_short} LDAP configuration, run the following to see if the user been pulled from LDAP with the right group. For example:

  # ldapsearch -x -H ldap://ldap-example:389 -LLL \ -b "ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" -s sub \ -D "ui=:userid,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" -w :password \ "(objectclass=organizationalPerson)

To test if the user belongs to right group, include one of the following lines in the `ldapsearch` command:

  (&(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=yourUserName) (memberof=CN=YourGroup,OU=Users,DC=YourDomain,DC=com))

or

  -b "ou=groups, dc=example,dc=com"



[[amazon_settings]]
====== Amazon Settings

If you choose Amazon as your authentication mode, required parameters are exposed under *Amazon Primary AWS Account Settings* for *IAM*. Be sure to validate your setting before saving them.

* Type in an *Access Key* provided by your Amazon account.
* Type in a *Secret Key* provided by your Amazon account.

Users logging into {product-title_short} with Amazon authentication enter their own IAM Access Key as the username and IAM Secret Key as the password.
Amazon users must be added as a {product-title_short} user or belong to an IAM user group added to the list of {product-title_short} groups.


[[external_ipa_auth]]
====== External Authentication (httpd)

When external authentication is enabled, users can log in to the {product-title_short} appliance using their IPA server credentials. The appliance creates user accounts automatically and imports relevant information from the IPA Server.

The appliance contains IPA client software for connecting to IPA servers, but it is not configured by default. External authentication is enabled by first configuring it in the web interface, then in the console.
Disabling external authentication and returning to internal database authentication also requires steps in both the web interface and the console.

*Requirements*

* For an appliance to leverage an IPA Server on the network, both the appliance and the IPA server must have their clocks synchronized or Kerberos and LDAP authentication fail.
* The IPA Server must be known by DNS and accessible by name. If DNS is not configured accordingly, the hosts files need to be updated to reflect both IPA server and the appliance on both virtual machines.
* For users to log in to the appliance using IPA server credentials, they must be members of at least one group on the IPA server which is also defined in the appliance. Navigate to the settings menu, then menu:Configuration[Access Control > Groups] to administer groups.

*Configuring the Appliance for External Authentication*

To configure the appliance for external authentication, first set up authentication using the web interface, then using the console.

Using the web interface:

. Log in to the web interface as an administrative user.
. Navigate to the settings menu, then menu:Configuration[Access Control > Zone > Server > NTP Servers] or use the hosting provider of the virtual machine to synchronize the appliance's time with an NTP server.
. Navigate to the settings menu, then menu:Configuration[Authentication].
. Select a *Session Timeout* if required.
. Select *External (httpd)* in the *Mode list*.
. Select *Enable Single Sign-On* to allow single sign-on using Kerberos tickets from client machines that authenticate to the same IPA server as the appliance.
. In the *Role Settings* area, select *Get User Groups* from *External Authentication (https)*.
. Click *Save*.

Using the console:

. Log in to the appliance console using the user name `admin`.
. The summary screen displays:
+
------
External Auth:  not configured
------
+
. Press Enter.
. Enter `10` to select Configure External Authentication (httpd).
. Enter the fully qualified hostname of the IPA Server, for example _ipaserver.test.company.com_.
. Enter the IPA server domain, for example _test.company.com_.
. Enter the IPA server realm, for example _TEST.COMPANY.COM_.
. Enter the IPA server principal, for example _admin_.
. Enter the password of the IPA server principal.
. Enter `y` to proceed.

[NOTE]
============
If any of the following conditions are true, configuration fails:

* The IPA server is not reachable by its FQDN
* The IPA server cannot reach the appliance by its FQDN
* The time is not synchronized between the appliance and the IPA server
* The IPA server admin password is entered incorrectly
============

*Reverting to Internal Database Authentication*

To revert to internal database authentication, first configure authentication using the web interface, then using the console.

Using the web interface:

. Log in to the web interface as an administrative user.
. Navigate to the settings menu, then menu:Configuration[Authentication].
. Select *Database* in the Mode list.
. Click *Save*.

Using the console:

. Log in to the appliance console using the user name `admin`.
. The summary screen displays:
+
------
External Auth:  IPA.server.FQDN
------
+
. Press `Enter`.
. Enter `10` to select Configure External Authentication (httpd). The currently configured IPA server hostname and domain are displayed.
. Enter `y` to un-configure the IPA client.

*Optional Configuration Using the Appliance Console CLI*

In addition to using the appliance console, external authentication can optionally be configured and un-configured using the appliance console command line interface.

Appliance console CLI command and relevant options include:

------
/bin/appliance_console_cli --host <appliance_fqdn>

[[external-authentication-SAML]]
====== Configuring External Authentication Using SAML

This procedure outlines how to manually configure an appliance to use SAML external authentication. While other SAML identity providers can be used with {product-title_short}, this procedure covers using Red Hat Single Sign-On (SSO) 7.0, which is implemented using the Apache HTTP server's `mod_auth_mellon` module.

To enable external authentication using SAML, complete the following steps to configure your HTTP server, then your {product-title_short} appliance.

[NOTE]
======
The current SAML implementation only secures the {product-title_short} appliance’s web administrative user interface with SAML. The REST API and self service user interface do not currently support SAML.
======

*Requirements*

The following is required in order to enable SAML authentication to the appliance:

* A CloudForms 4.6 appliance
* A SAML identity provider (e.g. Red Hat Single Sign-On (SSO) 7.0 or later)

[[configure-apache-SAML]]
*Configuring the HTTP Server for SAML*

The Apache HTTP server first must be configured to work with SAML authentication. All SAML-related certificates and keys are accessed from `/etc/httpd/saml2/`.

. Log into the {product-title_short} appliance as root using SSH, and create the `/etc/httpd/saml2/` directory:
+
------
# mkdir -p /etc/httpd/saml2
------
+
. Copy the `httpd` remote user and SAML template configuration files to the appliance:
+
------
# TEMPLATE_DIR="/opt/rh/cfme-appliance/TEMPLATE"
# cp ${TEMPLATE_DIR}/etc/httpd/conf.d/manageiq-remote-user.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/
# cp ${TEMPLATE_DIR}/etc/httpd/conf.d/manageiq-external-auth-saml.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/
------
+
[NOTE]
============
The following are notable SAML configuration defaults in the `manageiq-external-auth-saml.conf` file:

* Identity Provider Files (i.e. Red Hat SSO)
** Metadata File: `/etc/httpd/saml2/idp-metadata.xml`

* Service Provider Files (i.e. `mod_auth_mellon`)
** Private Key File: `/etc/httpd/saml2/miqsp-key.key`
** Certificate File: `/etc/httpd/saml2/miqsp-cert.cert`
** Metadata File: `/etc/httpd/saml2/miqsp-metadata.xml`

Other `mod_auth_mellon` parameters, such as endpoints and protected URLs, must not be modified as the appliance expects them to be defined as such.
============
+
. Generate the service provider files on the appliance using the Apache HTTP server's `mod_auth_mellon` command `mellon_create_metadata.sh`:
+
------
# cd /etc/httpd/saml2
# /usr/libexec/mod_auth_mellon/mellon_create_metadata.sh https://<miq-appliance> https://<miq-appliance>/saml2
------
+
The `mellon_create_metadata.sh` script creates file names based on the appliance URL.
+
. Rename the files created by the `mellon_create_metadata.sh` script to match the expected file names from the `manageiq-external-auth-saml.conf` file:
+
------
# mv https_<miq-appliance>.key  miqsp-key.key
# mv https_<miq-appliance>.cert miqsp-cert.cert
# mv https_<miq-appliance>.xml  miqsp-metadata.xml
------
+
. Now that the service provider's `metadata.xml` file has been generated, the service provider definition can be defined in the SAML identity provider.
For Red Hat SSO, a realm can be created for one or more appliances with individual clients defined one per appliance, where the client ID is specified as the URL of the appliance.
+
To add a client in the Red Hat SSO {product-title_short} realm:
+
.. Select and import the `miqsp-metadata.xml` file created for `mod_auth_mellon`.
.. Set the client ID as `https://<miq-appliance>`.
.. Set the client protocol as `saml`.
+
. Update the client definition for the appliance in Red Hat SSO with the following:
+
[options="header"]
|=========================================================================================
| Setting                                     | Value
| Name ID Format                              | username
| Valid Redirect URIs                         | https://<miq-appliance>/saml2/postResponse
| Assertion Consumer Service POST Binding URL | https://<miq-appliance>/saml2/postResponse
| Logout Service Redirect Binding URL         | https://<miq-appliance>/saml2/logout
|=========================================================================================
+
. Obtain the identity provider’s `idp-metadata.xml` metadata file as follows:
+
------
# cd /etc/httpd/saml2
# curl -s -o idp-metadata.xml \
  http://<redhatSSO-server>:8080/auth/realms/<miq-realm>/protocol/saml/descriptor
------
+
. In CloudForms 4.6, the following change is necessary to the `idp-metadata.xml` file for SAML logout to work between `mod_auth_mellon` and Red Hat SSO:
+
------
# vi idp-metadata.xml

  ...
  <SingleLogoutService
<   Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
---
>   Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect"
    Location=
  ...
------
+
. Restart the HTTP server on the appliance:
+
------
# systemctl restart httpd
------


[[configure-appliance-UI-SAML]]
*Configuring the Appliance Administrative User Interface*

After configuring the HTTP server for SAML, update the {product-title_short} appliance so that the administrative user interface works with SAML authentication.

. Login to the appliance as `admin`, and navigate to the settings menu, then menu:Configuration[Authentication].
. Set the mode to *External (httpd)*.
. Check *Enable SAML*. This enables the SAML login button on the appliance login screen, then redirects to the SAML protected page for authentication, and supports the SAML logout process.
. Check *Enable Single Signon*. With this option enabled, initial access to the appliance's administrative user interface redirects to the SAML identity provider authentication screen. Logging out from the appliance returns the user to the appliance login screen, allowing them to log in as `admin` unless *Disable Local Login* is also checked.
. Optional: Check *Disable Local Login* to disable the `admin` login to appliance and only allow SAML based authentication. Note that if there are issues with the identity provider or you require `admin` access to the appliance, you cannot log in through the appliance login screen until you re-enable local login as described in xref:re-enable-local-login[].
. Check *Get User Groups from External Authentication (httpd)*
. Click *Save*.

[IMPORTANT]
======
Ensure the user’s groups are created on the appliance and appropriate roles are assigned to those groups. See _SAML Assertions_ in xref:saml-assertions[] for more information on the parameters used by the {product-title_short} appliance.

For example, to configure user groups from your SAML identity provider to work with {product-title_short}:

  . In your SAML identity provider, specify your existing user groups in similar format to the following: `REMOTE_USER_GROUPS=Administrators;CloudAdministrators;Users`
  . On your {product-title_short} appliance, create the equivalent groups. See _Creating a User Group_ in xref:creating-a-user-group[].
  . On your {product-title_short} appliance, assign EVM roles to the groups. See _Creating a Role_ in xref:creating-a-role[].
======

Complete the above steps on each appliance in the settings menu, then navigate to menu:Configuration[Access Control].

You can now log into your {product-title_short} appliance using your SAML credentials.

[[saml-assertions]]
*SAML Assertions*

To authenticate to the {product-title_short} appliance using SAML, the following remote user parameters are looked at by the appliance upon a successful login and redirect from the identity provider. These parameters are used by the appliance to obtain group authentication information.


[options="header",cols="<2,<1",width="70%"]
|==============================================
| HTTP Environment           | SAML Assertion
| REMOTE_USER                | username
| REMOTE_USER_EMAIL          | email
| REMOTE_USER_FIRSTNAME      | firstname
| REMOTE_USER_LASTNAME       | lastname
| REMOTE_USER_FULLNAME       | fullname
| REMOTE_USER_GROUPS         | groups
|==============================================

For Red Hat SSO, the above SAML assertions can be defined for the appliance client in Red Hat SSO as mappers.

[options="header",cols="<1,<2,<1,<1"]
|============================================================================
| Name       | Category                  | Type           | Property
| username   | AttributeStatement Mapper | User Property  | username
| email      | AttributeStatement Mapper | User Property  | email
| firstname  | AttributeStatement Mapper | User Property  | firstName
| lastname   | AttributeStatement Mapper | User Property  | lastName
| fullname   | AttributeStatement Mapper | User Attribute | fullName
| groups     | Group Mapper              | Group List     | groups
|============================================================================

[IMPORTANT]
======
The `fullName` attribute was not available in the default database as of this writing and was added as a user attribute.
======



[[re-enable-local-login]]
*Re-enabling Local Login (Optional)*

If you disabled local login in the administrative user interface but need the ability to log in as `admin`, local login can be re-enabled using one of the following methods:

.Re-enabling Local Login from the Appliance Administrative User Interface

This method requires the identity provider to be available, and the ability to login as a user with enough administrative privileges to update {product-title_short} authentication settings.

. Log in to the appliance user interface as the administrative user.
. From the settings menu, select menu:Configuration[Authentication].
. Uncheck *Disable Local Login*.
. Click *Save*.

.Re-enabling Local Login from the Appliance Console:

. Use SSH to log into the appliance as `root`.
. Run the `appliance_console` command.
. Select *Update External Authentication Options*.
. Select *Enable Local Login*.
. Apply the updates.

Alternatively, log into the appliance as root using SSH, and run the following command:

------
# appliance_console_cli --extauth-opts local_login_disabled=false

[[diagnostics]]
=== Diagnostics

From the settings menu, select *Configuration*. Click on the *Diagnostics* tab to see the status of the different {product-title} roles and workers for each server, view and collect logs, and gather data if there are any gaps in capacity and utilization information.
The Diagnostics area is designed in a hierarchy.

* At the *region* level, you can see replication status, backup the VMDB, and run garbage collection on the VMDB.
* At the *zone* level, you can see {product-title} roles by servers and servers by roles. In addition, you can set log collection values for a specific zone, and collect gap data for capacity and utilization.
* At the *server* level, you can see the workers for each server, set log collection values for a specific server, and view current logs.

[[region-diagnostics]]
==== Region Diagnostics

Using the console, you can set the priority of server regional roles, review and reset replication, and create backups of your database either on demand or on a schedule.

Regions are used primarily to consolidate multiple VMDBs into one master VMDB for reporting while zones are used to define functional groups of servers. There can be only one region per VMDB, but multiple zones per region (or VMDB). Some server roles are aware of each other across {product-title} appliances at the region level. This means that redundancy and failover rules apply at the region level. You can also set priorities for the server roles that provide failover.

[[server-role-priorities]]
===== Server Role Priorities

If you have multiple servers in your environment with duplicate failover roles, then you can set the priority of the server role.

* Only server roles that support failover can be marked as primary. These roles only allow one server to be active at a time.
These are *Notifier*, *Capacity & Utilization Coordinator*, *Event Monitor*, *Scheduler*, *Storage Inventory*, and *Provider Inventory*.

* All other server roles are additive. The more servers with that role in a zone the more work that can be performed.

There are three role priorities.

* *Primary*: There can only be one primary per zone or region per role. When an appliance is started, the system looks to see if any role is set to primary.
If that is the case, the role is activated on that appliance and deactivated from the secondary. In the console, primary roles are shown in bold letters.
The text turns red if the server goes down. You must actively set the primary priority.

* *Secondary*: This is the default priority. There can be multiple secondaries. When an appliance is started, if no primary is found in the zone, the first appliance to start takes the role.
In the console, secondary roles are displayed normally with the word "secondary".

* *Tertiary*: If all appliances with primary roles or secondary roles were down, one of the tertiary would be activated.
The reason for tertiary is to ensure that if a server with crucial roles such as Provider Inventory or Event Monitor goes down, you have a way to associate those roles to different appliances by organizing the priorities.
Tertiary roles simply show as active in the console.

[[database-regions-and-replication]]
==== Database Regions and Replication

Regions are used to create a central database for reporting and charting. Do not use the database at the top level for operational tasks such as SmartState analysis or capacity and utilization data collection. Assign each server participating in the region a unique number during the regionalization process, then set your subordinate regions to replicate to the top region.

[IMPORTANT]
======
All {product-title} databases in a multi-region deployment must use the same security key.
======

[[creating_a_region]]
===== Creating a Region

In principle, a region is created when you set up your {product-title} environment on the first appliance for the region. However, you can also create a region on an appliance where a database has already been set up. This process involves dropping and rebuilding the existing database to accommodate the new region number, and takes several minutes to complete.

[WARNING]
======
Performing this procedure destroys any existing data and cannot be undone. Back up the existing database before proceeding. By default, new appliances are assigned region 0. Do not use this number when creating a region because duplicate region numbers can compromise the integrity of the data in the database.
======

. Log in to the appliance as the *root* user.
. Enter `appliance_console`, and press *Enter*.
. Press any key.
. Select `Stop EVM Server Processes`.
. Enter `Y` to confirm.
. Choose `Configure Database`.
. Enter a database region number that has not been used in your environment. Do not enter duplicate region numbers because this can corrupt the data.
. Enter `Y` to confirm.
. The menu reappears after all processes are complete.
. Select `Start EVM Server Processes`.
. Enter `Y` to confirm.
. Select *Quit* to exit the advanced settings menu.

[[configuring_database_replication]]
==== Configuring Database Replication and Centralized Administration

To configure database replication, you must configure one {product-title} instance to act as a global copy, and one or more other instances to act as remote copies. This database replication relationship can only be configured on {product-title} instances that are of the same version.

[NOTE]
====
Configuring database replication in this version of {product-title_short} automatically enables centralized administration, eliminating the need for further configuration.
====

Centralized administration in {product-title} supports life cycle management operations that can be initiated from the global copy and processed and executed on the remote copy.

[IMPORTANT]
======
* You must configure at least one remote copy before you can configure the global copy. Changes to the role of a {product-title} instance take several minutes to take effect.

* The region number must be unique on each {product-title} instance where replication is configured. See xref:creating_a_region[] for instructions on how to create a region.
======

[[binary-backup-and-restore-database]]
==== Performing a Binary Backup and Restoring the Database
Preserve data at the file system level by performing a binary backup.
This includes all databases, users and roles, and other objects.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure uses the `pg_basebackup` utility to perform a remote database backup and create a full replacement of the PostgreSQL data directory, capturing the exact state of the database when the backup finishes. For more information on the `pg_basebackup` utility, see the PostgreSQL documentation.
====

===== Performing a Binary Backup

Create a binary backup and store it as a `gzip` tar file inside the {product-title_short} backup directory.

[IMPORTANT]
======
PostgreSQL superuser or user with _Replication_ permissions are required to perform this procedure.
======

. SSH into the database server as the *root* user or provide PostgreSQL superuser credentials.
+
. Run the `pg_basebackup` command to create the backup.
+
-----
# pg_basebackup -x -h hostname -U root -Ft -z -D filename
-----
+
> where:
>
> *-h* _hostname_
>
>     Specifies the IP address of the database server.
>
> *-D* _filename_
>
>    Specifies the name of the directory created to contain the backup.

[[changing-database-password]]
==== Changing Database Password

[[changing-the-password-on-the-database-appliance]]
===== Changing the Password on the Database Appliance

{product-title} provides a default database password for the internal PostgreSQL database.

To change the password, you need to stop the {product-title} Service, change the password for the PostgreSQL database, run a command to change the password in the configuration file that `evmserverd` uses to access the server, and restart the {product-title} appliance.

. Stop the {product-title} service:
.. SSH into the appliance.
.. To stop the {product-title} service, run the following command:
+
------
service evmserverd stop
------
+
. Use `pgadmin` to change the password for your {product-title} database (default is `vmdb_production`). If you do not have `pgadmin`, you can change the password by running:
+
------
psql -U root -d vmdb_production
------
+
.. At the vmdb# prompt, type:
+
------
ALTER USER root WITH PASSWORD 'newpassword';
------
+
.. To exit psql, type:
+
------
\q
------
+
. Change the password in the configuration file that `evmserverd` uses to access the server:
+
------
/var/www/miq/vmdb/tools/fix_auth.rb --databaseyml --password newpassword
------
+
. Restart the {product-title} service:
+
------
service evmserverd start
------
+
. Verify that you can log in to the {product-title} console.


[[changing-the-password-on-the-worker-appliances]]
===== Changing the Password on the Worker Appliances

. Stop the {product-title} service:
.. SSH into the appliance.
.. To stop the {product-title} service, run the following command:
+
------
service evmserverd stop
------
+
. Change the password in the configuration file that `evmserverd` uses to access the server:
+
------
/var/www/miq/vmdb/tools/fix_auth.rb --databaseyml --password newpassword
------
+
. Restart the {product-title} service:
+
------
service evmserverd start
------
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Requisites for Replication*

If you change the password on the remote database, you will need to change the password in the subscription.
====

[[adding-a-new-appliance-to-an-existing-region]]
==== Adding a New Appliance to an Existing Region with a Non-default Password

. Create the new appliance.
. Start the appliance, but do not go into any of the configuration options, instead *SSH* into the new appliance.
. In the */var/www/miq/vmdb* directory, create a file called `REGION`. Its only contents should be the number of the Region that it is joining. (You could also just copy the `REGION` file from the VMDB appliance.)
. Edit the *database.yml* file in the */var/www/miq/vmdb* directory. (You may want to save from the original.)
.. Replace the contents of the *"production"* section with the contents of the *"base"* section.
.. Edit the *"host"* parameter to match the IP of the appliance hosting the VMDB.
.. Save the new *database.yml*.
. Run the following command to change the password in the configuration file that `evmserverd` uses to access the server:
+
------
/var/www/miq/vmdb/tools/fix_auth.rb --databaseyml --password newpassword
------
+
. Restart the new worker appliance:
+
------
service evmserverd restart
------
+


[[configuring-database-maintenance]]
==== Configuring Scheduled Database Maintenance

You can schedule hourly or periodic database maintenance through the appliance console. Performing regular PostgreSQL database maintenance helps to maintain a more responsive {product-title} environment.

Hourly database maintenance tasks, such as reindexing, are useful for highly active database tables such as metrics, workers, and servers.

You also may want to perform periodic database maintenance to truncate empty metrics tables and reorganize the database. Periodic maintenance can be configured to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, at a specified hour and on a specified day.

[NOTE]
====
Periodic maintenance can impact appliance performance while it is running. Red Hat recommends scheduling periodic maintenance infrequently, and at off hours.
====

To configure hourly and periodic database maintenance:

. Log in to the appliance as the *root* user.
. Enter `appliance_console`, and press *Enter*.
. Press any key.
. Select *Configure Database Maintenance* to configure the automatic database maintenance schedule through a dialog.
.. For *Configure Hourly Database Maintenance?* Type `y` or `n`.
.. For *Configure Periodic Database Maintenance?* Type `y` or `n`.

The next options depend on the periodic database maintenance frequency you choose, and are specified using the same dialog. The dialog finishes configuration with a *"Database maintenance configuration updated"* message when complete.

To reset your database maintenance settings, enter *Configure Database Maintenance* again from the appliance console menu, and confirm that you want to unconfigure the settings in the configuration dialog. This deletes the current settings.

To configure a new database maintenance schedule, enter the *Configure Database Maintenance* menu item once again and configure the values using the dialog.
