These known issues exist in Red Hat CloudForms at this time:

BZ#link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1225541[1225541]

------

At current, attempting to perform a Smart State analysis of a VMware vSphere 6 virtual machine with Virtual Disk Development Kit 6.0 returns an 'Unable to determine port' error, causing the analysis to fail. As a workaround, use Virtual Disk Development Kit 5.5. This issue will be resolved in a future release of Red Hat CloudForms.
