= Recommendations for migration

The following recommendations will minimize the impact of the migration on your environment.

Checking your resources::
* Ensure that you have sufficient space for the migration. The migration process does not delete the original virtual machines.
* Plan for redundancy.

Scheduling the migration::
* Schedule your migration carefully, to minimize the impact on your users.
* Prepare your users for downtime.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, IMS supports only cold migration. Virtual machines are powered off gracefully as part of the migration process.
====

* Stagger the migration schedules.
* Move critical applications during maintenance windows.

Distributing the migration workload::
* Create migration groups, so that you are not migrating all of your virtual machines at the same time, keeping in mind the following considerations:

** How are the virtual machines grouped now?
** Which virtual machines should be migrated together?
** Which workloads or linked applications should be migrated together?
** What applications must remain available?

* Consider which parts of the workload to migrate first:

** Databases
** Applications
** Web servers
** Load balancers

Deploying the conversion hosts::
* Create an appropriate number of conversion hosts. See xref:How_many_conversion_hosts[]
* Choose the best datapath transformation option for your environment. See xref:Choosing_vddk_or_ssh_transformation[]
* OpenStack Platform:
** Deploy the conversion hosts on multiple hypervisors.
** Deploy the conversion hosts on a compute node with nested virtualization enabled (see link:https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/guides/devstack-with-nested-kvm.html[]). Nested virtualization is a technology preview.

Controlling the migration process::
* Create multiple migration plans for finer control.
* Perform test migrations with different maximum numbers of concurrent migrations to assess the capabilities of your environment's infrastructure. See xref:Changing_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations[].

[[How_many_conversion_hosts]]
== How many conversion hosts do I need?

The number of conversion hosts you create depends on the size of your migration. All the virtual machines in the migration plan are migrated at the same time, in parallel. The number of virtual machines that you can migrate simultaneously depends on your infrastructure capabilities. Each migration requires a certain amount of network bandwidth, I/O throughput, and processing power for the conversion process.

Multiple conversion hosts provide load-balancing and better performance, even for small migrations.

Conversion hosts and providers are limited to ten concurrent migrations, unless you change the default maximum number of concurrent migrations (see xref:Changing_the_maximum_number_of_concurrent_migrations[]).

Test your environment thoroughly before the migration to determine how many migrations it can support without negative effects, for example, five conversion hosts, each running ten concurrent migrations.

[[Choosing_vddk_or_ssh_transformation]]
== Which datapath transformation option, VDDK or SSH?

You configure your conversion hosts to use either VDDK (VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit) or SSH as the datapath for converting the virtual machines. The choice is determined by the number of virtual machines you are migrating and the capabilities of your infrastructure.

The following table compares these options.

[cols="1,2,2", options="header"]
.VDDK and SSH comparison
|===
| ^|Pros ^|Cons
|*VDDK* .<a|* Recommended because it is approximately twice as fast as SSH
* Compiled with `nbdkit`, which provides direct connectivity to the virtual machine disks
.<a|* Requires VDDK package download
* Requires VDDK library location for configuring the conversion hosts
|*SSH* .<a|* Better suited for large-scale migrations than VDDK
* Does not require additional downloads, packages, tools, or compilation
.<a|* Slower than VDDK
* Requires the VMware hypervisors to have SSH access enabled
* Requires shared SSH keys for the source and target environments
