	<title>Viewing Capacity and Utilization Charts for a Virtual Machine</title>
	<para>
		You can view capacity and utilization data for virtual machines that are part of a cluster. Note that daily charts only include full days of data. If all 24 data points for a day are not available, daily charts are not displayed. For some capacity and utilization data, CloudForms Management Engine calculates and shows trend lines in the charts which are created using linear regression. The calculation uses the capacity and utilization data collected by CloudForms Management Engine during the interval you specify.
	</para>
	<note>
		<para>
			You must have a server with network visibility to your provider assigned the server role of <guilabel>Capacity &amp; Utilization Collector</guilabel> to use this feature.
		</para>
		<para>
			The virtual machine must be powered on to collect the data.
