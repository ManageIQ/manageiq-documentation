= Searching for Virtual Machines or Templates

To the right of the taskbar on the [label]#Virtual Machines# page, you can enter names or parts of names for searching.
You can search in the following ways. 

* Type characters that are _included_ in the name.
  For example, if you type [literal]+sp1+, all Virtual Machines whose names include [literal]+sp1+ appear, such as [literal]+Windows2003sp1+ and [literal]+Sp1clone+. 
* Use [literal]+*+ at the end of a term to search for names that _begin_ with specific characters.
  For example, type [literal]+v*+ to find all virtual machines whose names begin with the letter [literal]+v+. 
* Use [literal]+*+ at the beginning of a term to search for names that _end_ with specific characters.
  For example, type [literal]+*sp2+ to find all virtual machines whose names end with [literal]+sp2+. 
* Erase all characters from the search box to go back to viewing all virtual machines.
