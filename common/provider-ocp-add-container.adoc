. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Providers].
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then click  image:1862.png[Add a New Containers Provider] (*Add a New Containers Provider*).
. Enter a *Name* for the provider.
. From the *Type* list, select *OpenShift Container Platform*.
. Enter the appropriate *Zone* for the provider. If you do not specify a zone, it is set to `default`.
. From the *Alerts* list, select *Prometheus* to enable external alerts. Selecting *Prometheus* adds an *Alerts* tab to the lower pane to configure the Prometheus service. Alerts are disabled by default.
. From the *Metrics* list, select *Hawkular* or *Prometheus* to collect capacity and utilization data, or leave as *Disabled*. Selecting *Prometheus* or *Hawkular* adds a *Metrics* tab to the lower pane for further configuration. Metrics are disabled by default.
. In the *Default* tab, configure the following for the OpenShift provider: 
.. Select a *Security Protocol* method to specify how to authenticate the provider:
* *SSL*: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required for this option.
* *SSL trusting custom CA*: Authenticate the provider with a self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your provider’s CA certificate to the *Trusted CA Certificates* box in PEM format.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can obtain your OpenShift Container Platform provider's CA certificate for all endpoints (default, metrics, alerts) from `/etc/origin/master/ca.crt`. Paste the output (a block of text starting with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`) into the *Trusted CA Certificates* field.
====
+
* *SSL without validation*: Authenticate the provider insecurely (not recommended).
.. Enter the *Hostname* (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) of the provider.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The *Hostname* must use a unique fully qualified domain name.
====
+
.. Enter the *API Port* of the provider. The default port is `8443`.
.. Enter a token for your provider in the *Token* box.
+
[NOTE]
====
To obtain a token for your provider, run the `oc get secret` command on your provider; see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html-single/managing_providers/#Obtaining_OpenShift_Container_Platform_Management_Token[Obtaining an OpenShift Container Platform Management Token].

For example:

# oc get secret --namespace management-infra management-admin-token-8ixxs --template='{{index .data "ca.crt"}}' | base64 --decode
====
+
.. Click *Validate* to confirm that {product-title} can connect to the OpenShift Container Platform provider.
. If you selected a metrics service, configure the service details in the *Metrics* tab:
.. Select a *Security Protocol* method to specify how to authenticate the service:
* *SSL*: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required for this option.
* *SSL trusting custom CA*: Authenticate the provider with a self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your provider’s CA certificate to the *Trusted CA Certificates* box in PEM format.
+
[NOTE]
====
In OpenShift, the default deployment of the router generates certificates during installation, which can be used with the *SSL trusting custom CA* option. Connecting a Hawkular endpoint with this option requires the CA certificate that the cluster uses for service certificates, which is stored in `/etc/origin/master/service-signer.crt` on the first master in a cluster.
====
+
* *SSL without validation*: Authenticate the provider insecurely using SSL. (Not recommended)
.. Enter the *Hostname* (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) of the provider, or use the *Detect* button to find the hostname.
.. Enter the *API Port* if your Hawkular provider uses a non-standard port for access. The default port is `443`.
.. Click *Validate* to confirm that {product-title} can connect to the metrics endpoint.
. For the *Prometheus* alerts service, add the Prometheus alerts endpoint in the *Alerts* tab:
.. Select a *Security Protocol* method to specify how to authenticate the service:
* *SSL*: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required for this option.
* *SSL trusting custom CA*: Authenticate the provider with a self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your provider’s CA certificate to the *Trusted CA Certificates* box in PEM format.
* *SSL without validation*: Authenticate the provider insecurely using SSL. (Not recommended)
.. Enter the *Hostname* (or IPv4 or IPv6 address) or alert *Route*. 
.. Enter the *API Port* if your Prometheus provider uses a non-standard port for access. The default port is `443`.
.. Click *Validate* to confirm that {product-title_short} can connect to the alerts service.
. Click the *Advanced* tab to add image inspector settings for scanning container images on your provider using OpenSCAP.
+
[NOTE]
====
These settings control downloading the image inspector container image from the registry and obtaining the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) information (for effective scanning) via a proxy. The URLs required by {product-title_short} to be open for OpenSCAP scanning are: 

* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/ds/
* https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=

The information about the list of URLs is based on the source code of OpenSCAP.
====
+
.. Enter proxy information for the provider in *HTTP*, *HTTPS*, and *NO Proxy*.
.. Enter the *Image-Inspector Repository* information.
.. Enter the *Image-Inspector Registry* information. 
.. Enter the *Image-Inspector Tag* value. A tag is a mark used to differentiate images in a repository, typically by the application version stored in the image.
.. Enter the *CVE location*.
. Click *Add*.

[NOTE]
====
You can also set global default image-inspector settings for all OpenShift providers in the advanced settings menu by editing the values under `ems_kubernetes`, instead of setting this for each provider. 

For example:

:ems_kubernetes:
    :image_inspector_registry: registry.access.redhat.com
    :image_inspector_repository: openshift3/image-inspector
