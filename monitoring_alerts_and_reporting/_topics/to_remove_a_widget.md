### Removing a Widget

You can remove a widget when you no longer need the widget to be
displayed in the dashboard.

1.  Navigate to **Overview > Dashboard**.

2.  From the widget that you want to remove, click
    ![2260](../images/2260.png) **(Remove from Dashboard)** in the upper
    right corner of the widget.

3.  Click **OK**.

The widget is removed from the dashboard, but it is not deleted. It can
be added again if needed.
