=== Assigning Tags to Storage Items

Use tags to describe your storage items based on your enterprise needs. For example, you can categorize by geographic location or function. Create the required user and company tags under Configuration, and specify them under each resource. 

==== To Assign Tags to Storage Items

[arabic]
. From +Storage+, navigate to the page of items, such as +File Shares+ that you want to tag.
. Check the specific instances of the type of item you want to tag.
. Click image:1941.png[Policy] +Policy+, and then image:2148.png[EditTags] +Edit Tags+.
. Select a customer tag from the first dropdown, and then a value for the tag.
. Select more tags or click +Save+ to save your changes.


=== Viewing Utilization Data

As soon as you connect to a storage agent, the server collects data on the utilization of Filers, LUNs, and Volumes. You can view this data directly from the console from the appropriate storage page.

==== To View Utilization Data

[arabic]
. From +Storage+, click the +Filers+, +LUNs+, or +Volumes page+.
. Click the item that you want to view the data for.
. Click +Monitoring+, and then +Utilization+ on the task bar.
