=== Invoking Automate using a Custom Button

Invoke an Automate model by mapping an Ansible playbook or instance from the `/System/Process/Request` class to a custom button. Before creating the button, you need to have an Ansible playbook service catalog item or an instance in the `/System/Process/Request` class to map to it and a button group to
assign it to.

Create buttons for a cluster, host, datastore, provider, virtual
machines or cloud instances. When the button is clicked, the model or playbook will be invoked for the selected item. For each of these, you can have up to 15 buttons.
