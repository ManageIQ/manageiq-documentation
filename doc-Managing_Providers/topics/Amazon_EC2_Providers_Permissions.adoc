= Permissions for Amazon EC2 Providers

Red Hat recommends using Amazon EC2's _Power User_ Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy when adding Amazon EC2 as a cloud provider in {product-title_short}.
This policy allows those in the _Power User_ group full access to AWS services except for user administration, meaning a {product-title_short} API user can access all of the API functionality, but cannot access or change user
permissions.

Further limiting API access limitations can limit Automate capabilities, as Automate
scripts directly access the AWS SDK to create brand new
application functionality.

The AWS services primarily accessed by the {product-title_short} API include:

* Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
* CloudFormation
* CloudWatch
* Elastic Load Balancing
* Simple Notification Service (SNS)
* Simple Queue Service (SQS)
