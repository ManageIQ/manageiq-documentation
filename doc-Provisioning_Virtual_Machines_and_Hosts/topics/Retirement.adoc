== Retirement

=== Retiring Virtual Machines

==== Retiring Virtual Machines and Instances

When a virtual machine or instance is no longer required, it can be retired. Once a virtual machine or instance reaches its retirement date, it is immediately shut down and not allowed to restart. If an attempt to restart is made, {product-title} will shut down the virtual machine or instance.

There are three built-in policies involved with retirement:

* If the virtual machine or instance reaches its retirement date, it will be stopped even if it is running.
* If a retired virtual machine or instance is requested to start through {product-title}, the virtual machine or instance will not be allowed to start.
* If a provider starts a retired virtual machine or instance outside of {product-title}, the virtual machine or instance will be stopped.

{product-title} provides a number of ways to retire a virtual machine or instance:

* By using the allocated buttons in the {product-title} console.
* When creating a provision request, a retirement date can be set up.

==== Using the {product-title} Console to Retire

Through the {product-title} console, you can retire a virtual machine on a specific date or immediately.

==== Retiring a Virtual Machine Immediately

. Navigate to menu:Services[Workloads].
. Select the virtual machine or instance that you want to retire.
. Click image:2007.png[](*Lifecycle*), then image:2010.png[](*Retire this VM/Instance*).

The virtual machine or instance is immediately stopped, and will be shut down if an attempt is made to restart it.

==== Setting a Retirement Date for a Virtual Machine or Instance

. Navigate to menu:Services[Workloads].
. Select the virtual machine that you want to set a retirement date for.
. Click image:2007.png[](*Lifecycle*), then image:2010.png[](*Set/remove retirement date*).
. Select a date using the calendar control.
. Click *Save*.

The retirement date is set, and displays in the virtual machine or instance summary screen.

==== Removing a Retirement Date for a Virtual Machine or Instance

. Navigate to menu:Services[Workloads].
. Select the virtual machine or instance that you want to remove the retirement date from.
. Click image:2007.png[](*Lifecycle*), then click image:2010.png[](*Set Retirement Date*).
. Click image:2009.png[](*Remove Retirement Date*).

=== Setting Retirement in a Provision Request

If you are using {product-title} to provision, you can set when you want retirement in the provision request. To see how to create a request, go to *Provisioning Requests*. A warning email will be sent to the owner before the retirement.

==== Scheduling Retirement in a Provision Request

After provisioning either a Cloud Instance or Virtual Machine, a multi-tabbed screen appears where you can set up your provision requests. The *Schedule* tab allows you to choose to power on the virtual machines or instances after they are created, and to set a retirement date. If you select a retirement period, you will be prompted for when you want a retirement warning.

=== Extending Retirement Dates

{product-title} *Automate* includes a method to extend the retirement of a virtual machine or instance by 14 days. This section describes how to create a button that invokes this method and how to edit the method to change the number of days.

==== Creating a Custom Button to Extend Retirement

. Navigate to menu:Automate[Customization].
. Click the *Buttons* accordion.
. From the *Object Types* tree, select *VM and Instance*.
. Navigate to the button group to which you want to add this button. (If you do not have a button group, add one and then create the button.)
. Click image:1847.png[](*Configuration*), then image:1862.png[](*Add a new Button*).
. Type in a button text and button hover text, and select the image you want to use.
. In *Object Details*, select *Request* from the */System/Process/* dropdown. By default, the message is `create`. Do not change it.
. In *Request*, type `vm_retire_extend`.
. Click *Add*.

==== Changing the Number of Days to Extend Retirement

. Navigate to menu:Automate[Explorer].
. Click menu:DOMAIN[Cloud > VM > Retirement > Email > vm_retire_extend].

[NOTE]
======
DOMAIN must be a user-defined Domain and not the locked ManageIQ Domain. If necessary, you can copy the class from the ManageIQ domain into a custom domain.

This example uses the *Cloud* Namespace, but you can also use the *Infrastructure* namespace.
