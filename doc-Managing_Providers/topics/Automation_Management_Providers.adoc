= Automation Management Providers

In {product-title}, an automation management provider is a management tool that integrates with {product-title_short} to simplify automation operations for your resources. This chapter describes the automation management providers that you can use with {product-title}, and how to work with them. 

{product-title} provides automation management features through the following:

*Automate* enables real-time, bi-directional process integration. This provides you with a method to implement adaptive automation for management events and administrative or operational activities.

*Ansible* integration delivers out-of-the-box support for backing service, alert and policy actions using Ansible playbooks. Sync your existing playbook repositories with CloudForms, add credentials to access providers, and create service catalog items for actions ranging from creating and retiring VMs, updating security software, or adding additional disks when space runs low. 

*Ansible Tower* is a management tool integrated with {product-title_short}, designed to help automate infrastructure operations utilizing existing Ansible Tower providers in your inventory. {product-title_short} allows you to execute Ansible Tower jobs using service catalogs and Automate. Using Ansible Tower, you can schedule Ansible playbook runs and monitor current and historical results, allowing for troubleshooting or identification of issues before they occur.


[[ansible-inside]]
== Ansible  

Ansible integrates with {product-title} to provide automation solutions, using playbooks, for Service, Policy and Alert actions. 
Ansible playbooks consist of series of _plays_ or tasks that define automation across a set of hosts,
known as the inventory. 

Ranging from simple to complex tasks, Ansible playbooks can support cloud management:

* *Services* - allow a playbook to back a {product-title_short} service catalog item.
* *Control Actions* - {product-title_short} policies can execute playbooks as actions based on events from providers.
* *Control Alerts* - set a playbook to launch prompted by a {product-title_short} alert.

Ansible is built into {product-title_short} so there is nothing to install. The basic workflow when using Ansible in {product-title} is as follows:

. Enable the *Embedded Ansible* server role.
. Add a source control repository that contains your playbooks.
. Establish credentials with your inventory. 
. Back your services, alerts and policies using available playbooks. 


[[enabling-embedded-ansible-server-role]]
=== Enabling the Embedded Ansible Server Role
In {product-title}, the *Embedded Ansible* role is disabled by default. Enable this server role to utilize Ansible Automation Inside. 

[NOTE]
====
Configure your {product-title_short} appliance network identity (hostname/IP address) before enabling the Embedded Ansible server role. Restart the `evmserverd` service on the appliance with the enabled Embedded Ansible server role after making any changes to the hostname or IP address.
====

. Navigate to the settings menu, then *Configuration* &#8594; *Settings*.
. Select the desired server under *Zones*.
. Set the *Server Role* for *Embedded Ansible* to *On*.

[[ansible-tower]]
== Ansible Tower

Ansible Tower is a management tool integrated with {product-title}, designed to help automate infrastructure operations. {product-title} allows you to execute Ansible Tower jobs using service catalogs and Automate. No custom configuration or Ruby scripting is needed in {product-title}, as configuration is done in Ansible Tower using playbooks. 

You can use the large library of existing Ansible playbooks as {product-title} state machines to automate tasks such as backups, package updates, and maintenance in your {product-title} environment. This also includes deploying Red Hat Satellite agents on bare metal machines as required. This can be particularly useful for quickly applying changes across large environments with many virtual machines or instances. Using Ansible Tower, you can schedule Ansible playbook runs and monitor current and historical results, allowing for troubleshooting or identification of issues before they occur.

The basic workflow when using {product-title} with an Ansible Tower provider is as follows:

. Create an Ansible playbook which performs a specific task.
. A new Ansible Tower job template is created from the playbook, which is then retrieved by {product-title}.
. From the Ansible Tower job template, create a new catalog item in {product-title}, optionally with a service dialog that allows the user to enter parameters if needed.
. The user orders the service from the {product-title} user interface, and fills out any additional arguments (for example, limiting the task to run on a specific set of virtual machines). 
. The job executes.


[NOTE]
====
For more information on Ansible playbooks, see the link:https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html[Ansible playbook documentation].

[[refreshing-an-ansible-tower-provider]]
=== Refreshing an Ansible Tower Provider

Refresh relationships of all items related to an existing Ansible Tower configuration management provider including inventory, hosts, virtual machines, and clusters.

You can refresh inventory from {product-title}, or by enabling the *Update on Launch* option for inventory groups in Ansible Tower. The *Update on Launch* option allows Ansible Tower to automatically update inventory using a dynamic inventory script before launching an Ansible Tower job from a playbook. See the link:http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/index.html[Ansible Tower documentation] for more information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It can take a long time to retrieve information from providers containing many virtual machines or instances. The Ansible Tower dynamic inventory script can be modified to limit updates to specific items and reduce refresh time. 
====

To refresh an Ansible Tower provider's inventory in {product-title}:

. Navigate to menu:Automation[Ansible Tower > Explorer] and click the *Providers* accordion tab.
. Select the checkboxes for the Ansible Tower providers to refresh under *All Ansible Tower Providers*.
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), and then image:2003.png[Refresh Relationships and Power States] (*Refresh Relationships and Power States*).
. Click *OK*.

{product-title} then queries the Ansible Tower API and obtains an inventory of all available hosts and job templates.

[[viewing-ansible-tower-providers-and-inventory]]

[[executing-an-ansible-tower-job-using-a-custom-automate-button]]
=== Executing an Ansible Tower Job Using a Custom Automate Button

{product-title} can execute Ansible Tower jobs on virtual machines or instances using custom buttons in Automate.

Ansible Tower jobs can either be non-customizable, which do not require any extra configuration from the user, or alternatively, they can allow the user to specify a parameter (for example, a package name to install). In Ansible Tower jobs containing a dialog, {product-title} accepts additional  information from the user and adds it to the appropriate API call in Automate, and then sends it into Ansible Tower.

.Prerequisites

Before creating an Automate button to execute an Ansible Tower job, the following must be configured:

* An Ansible playbook in Ansible Tower. See the link:https://docs.ansible.com/[Ansible Tower documentation] for instructions.
* Ansible Tower must be able to reach virtual machines or instances deployed by {product-title} at the IP level.
* The virtual machine template must have the Ansible Tower environment's public SSH key injected. For cloud instances, `cloud-init` can be used and the public SSH key can be passed without rebuilding the image.
* Any dynamic inventory scripts used must be configured to return the virtual machine names exactly as they are stored in {product-title}, without the UUID appended.

.Executing an Ansible Tower Job using a Custom Automate Button

To configure a custom button to execute an Ansible Tower job on a virtual machine or instance, first create the button:

. Navigate to menu:Automation[Automate > Customization].
. Click the *Buttons* accordion menu.
. Click menu:VM and Instance[Unassigned Buttons]. This configures the button to run on virtual machines or instances.
. Click  image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), then click  image:1862.png[] (*Add a new Button*). 
  * In the *Adding a new Button* screen, configure the *Action* parameters as desired. *Dialog* can be left blank if the playbook does not require extra variables. To ask the user to enter extra information when running the task, *Service Dialog* must be selected.
  * Configure *Object Details* fields with the following request details:
    ** For *System/Process*, select *Request*.
    ** For *Message*, enter *create*.
    ** For *Request*, enter *Ansible_Tower_Job*. 
  * Configure *Attribute/Value Pairs* with the following parameters:
    ** *job_template_name* is the Ansible Tower job template name to associate with the button. The *job_template_name* field is mandatory; other parameters are provided by the Tower job dialog.
  * Configure *Visibility* to all users, or limit visibility by role as desired.
+
image:Add_button.png[]
+
  * Click *Add*.

If you do not have an existing button group to assign the new button to, create a new button group:

. From menu:Automation[Automate > Customization], navigate to menu:Buttons[VM and Instance > Add a new Button Group], and configure the following:
  * Configure *Basic Info* as desired. For example, name the button group `VM Actions`.
  * In *Assign Buttons*, select the button you just created from the *Unassigned* list and click image:1876.png[] to assign it to *Selected*.
+
image:Create_button_group.png[]
+
  * Click *Add*.

To assign the button to an existing button group:

. Navigate to menu:Buttons[VM and Instance > VM Actions > Edit this Button Group].
. In *Assign Buttons*, select the button you just created from the *Unassigned* list and click image:1876.png[] to assign it to *Selected*.
. Click *Add*.

To use the button to run an Ansible Tower job on a virtual machine:

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Virtual Machines].
. Select the virtual machine to run the Ansible Tower job template on.
. Click the *VM Actions* button to show the button you created, and click the button from the list to run the Ansible Tower job template.
+
image:Run_Update_Button.png[]
+
. Click *Submit* to execute the job.

{product-title} then confirms the job has been executed. 

If you selected a service dialog to run when creating the button, {product-title} will then prompt you to enter variables to complete the task. After entering your desired parameters, {product-title} takes you to the *Requests* page.

The service item's details can be viewed in menu:Services[My Services] in {product-title}.
