=== Copying a Class or Instance

. Navigate to menu:Automate[Explorer]. The default view is the Datastore.

. Navigate through the various Domains and Namespaces until you reach the
desired class or instance to copy.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), then either (*Copy this Class*) or (*Copy this Instance*) depending on the object chosen.

. Choose the target Domain in the *To Domain* drop-down menu.

. The object retains the same path as the *From Domain* and overrides the
class in *From Domain* if the *To Domain* has a high priority. You can also untick the *Copy to same path* option to specify a new Namespace.

. Click *Add*.
