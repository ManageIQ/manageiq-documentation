When adding an OpenStack cloud or infrastructure provider, you can enable _tenant mapping_ in {product-title_short} to map any existing tenants from that provider. This means {product-title_short} will create new cloud tenants to match each existing OpenStack tenant; each new cloud tenant and its corresponding OpenStack tenant will have identical resources assignments (including user and role synchronization) with the exception of quotas. Tenant quotas are not synchronized between {product-title_short} and OpenStack, and are available for reporting purposes only. You can manage quotas in {product-title_short} but this will not affect the quotas created in OpenStack.

During a provider refresh, {product-title_short} will also check for any changes to the tenant list in OpenStack. {product-title_short} will create new cloud tenants to match any new tenants, and delete any cloud tenants whose corresponding OpenStack tenants no longer exist. {product-title_short} will also replicate any changes to OpenStack tenants to their corresponding cloud tenants.
