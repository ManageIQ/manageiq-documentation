= Pausing / Resuming Containers Providers

In {product-title_short}, you can pause and resume containers providers. This allows users to add a number of potentially resource-intensive providers, then pause and resume those that are not required at a given time. Additionally, when performing maintenance on a provider, you can pause the provider to prevent {product-title_short} from connecting to it, to avoid generating log errors or collecting partial data.

[NOTE]
====
* While the provider is paused no data will be collected from it. This may cause gaps in inventory, metrics and events. 

* Also, the provider itself is not turned off when paused, but only temporarily disables the link between {product-title_short} and the provider. Resuming the provider re-enables the link between {product-title_short} and the provider.
