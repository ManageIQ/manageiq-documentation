## Catalogs and Services

Through the use of catalogs, {{ site.data.product.title_short }} provides support for
multi-tier service provisioning to deploy layered workloads across
hybrid environments. You can create customized dialogs that will give
consumers of the services the ability to input just a few parameters and
provision the entire service. The following table lists the terminology
associated with catalogs that you will use within the
{{ site.data.product.title_short }} user interface for service provisioning.

| Type                 | Information                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Terminology

### Generic Objects

Generic Objects are object-like entities, defined at runtime, that have
unique names and user-defined attributes and relationships. Residing in
the Automate Engine datastore, generic objects are designed to manage
objects other than those related to private infrastructure, and public
or private cloud providers.

Using automate requests, services and catalog items, generic objects can
be directly accessed or passed, during any step, as a parameter to a
service state machine. As a result, generic objects can be used to
quickly add the capability to provision and collect data on resources
not supported by {{ site.data.product.title_short }}.

#### Viewing Generic Objects Classes

View a list of generic objects and click through to see detailed summary
information for each object.

1.  Navigate to menu:Automate\[Generic Objects\].

2.  Click on a generic object class in the table to view its summary
    information.

#### Creating Generic Objects Classes

{% include create-dynamic-resource-object.md %}

#### Editing Generic Object Classes

{% include edit-dynamic-resource-object.md %}

#### Removing Generic Objects Classes

{% include remove-dynamic-resource-object.md %}

#### Exporting Generic Objects

Export generic objects from {{ site.data.product.title_short }} to create a shared library.

Exporting a generic object requires the object has been created in
{{ site.data.product.title_short }}.

{% include export-generic-objects.md %}

Locate the exported yaml file containing the generic object properties
in the temporary folder.

#### Importing Generic Objects

Import generic objects to {{ site.data.product.title_short }} from a shared library.

{% include import-generic-objects.md %}

Confirm the generic objects have imported successfully by [Viewing
Generic Objects Classes](#view-generic-objects) in the
{{ site.data.product.title_short }} user interface.

### Service Dialogs

When provisioning a service, input will be needed from the requester.
Service dialogs are used to take input from the user. This input is
connected to a method in the Automate model that defines how the userâ€™s
input is translated into the provision request. Before creating a
service dialog, be sure to plan what items you need the user to input.

#### Adding a Service Dialog

<div class="important">

  - When creating a service dialog for use with Ansible playbook catalog
    items, variable elements must use the prefix **param\_** when
    assigning the value. For example, a new variable labeled **key1**
    should have its value set as **param\_key1**.

  - Using Ansible playbooks to populate dynamic dialog fields is not
    recommended due to delay times caused by the overhead of interaction
    between systems.

  - If you add the playbook automate method to a service dialog, only
    users with admin privileges can run the dialog.

</div>

{% include service-dialog-creation-using-dialog-editor.md %}

##### Creating a Service Dialog from a Container Template

Complete the following procedure to create a Service Dialog from a
Container Template.

1.  Navigate to menu:Compute\[Containers \> Container Templates\] and
    select the template for provisioning.

2.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png)(**Configuration**), then
    ![1862](../images/1862.png)(**Create Service Dialog from Container
    Template**).

3.  Enter a name for the dialog in **Service Dialog Name**.

4.  Click **Save**.

You can use this service dialog when creating a catalog item for
container template provisioning; see [Creating an OpenShift Template
Catalog Item](#create-container-template-catalog-item).

##### Importing Service Dialogs

You can share service dialogs between appliances using the export and
import features.

1.  Navigate to menu:Automation\[Embedded Automate \> Customization\].

2.  In the **Import/Export** accordion, click **Service Dialog
    Import/Export**.

3.  In the **Import** area, click **Browse** to select an import file.

4.  Click **Upload**.

##### Exporting Service Dialogs

You can share service dialogs between appliances using the export and
import features.

1.  Navigate to menu:Automation\[Embedded Automate \> Customization\].

2.  In the **Import/Export** accordion, click **Service Dialog
    Import/Export**.

3.  In the **Export** area, select the service dialogs that you want to
    export.

4.  Click **Export**.

#### Methods

##### Creating a Method to Associate with the Dialog

You will need to create a method that connects the values in the dialog
with the provisioning request. The method should be created in the
`DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template`
class of the **Automate** model.

**Note:**

**DOMAIN** must be a user-defined Domain and not the locked ManageIQ Domain. If necessary, you can copy the class from the ManageIQ domain into a custom domain.

A method is provided below that was created for the following scenario:

  - You want to provision a three-tiered service that contains catalog
    items of web, app and DB. Each of these virtual machines (or cloud
    instances) has been tagged under the **Service** category with the
    appropriate value. Then, added as a catalog item and combined into a
    catalog bundle.

  - The **Service Dialog** captures the selection of small, medium or
    large application in a dropdown called **service\_type**. When
    referring to a value captured in an element in a dialog, the name of
    the element should be prefixed with **dialog\_**. For example,
    **service\_type** becomes **dialog\_service\_type** when used in the
    method.

  - The method will set the memory sizes for each of the catalog items
    based on the **service\_type** selection.

![6298](../images/6298.png)

**Note:**

After the method has been created, it must be mapped to an instance in the `DOMAIN/Service/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines` class. The name of the instance must be specified as the **Entry Point**. This method
must be called before the provision job begins.

##### Associating a Method with an Automate Instance

Service methods have been split based on purpose.

1.  Navigate to menu:Automation\[Embedded Automate \> Explorer\].

2.  From the accordion menu, click the required service method.

3.  Service Class is located at menu:DOMAIN\[Service \> Provisioning \>
    StateMachines \> Methods\] and menu:Domain\[Service \> Retirement \>
    StateMachines \> Methods\].

    **Note:**

    **DOMAIN** must be a user-defined Domain and not the locked ManageIQ Domain. If necessary, you can copy the class from the ManageIQ domain into a custom domain.

4.  Either create a new instance or select the **clone\_to\_service**
    instance.

5.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png)(**Configuration**), then
    ![1851](../images/1851.png)(**Edit Selected Instance**).

6.  In the **configurechilddialog** value, put the path to the method.

7.  Click **Save** or **Add** if you are adding this to a new instance.

### Catalogs

Catalogs are used to create groups of virtual machines or instances for
provisioning. For example, a complete package of a database server,
desktop with specialized software already on it, and a firewall. You
will need to complete the following steps to create and provision a
service catalog.

1.  Create **Catalog Items** for each virtual machine or instance that
    will be part of the service.

2.  Create a **Service** dialog. For example, create a dropdown with
    three options small, medium, and large.

3.  Create a method for the Service Dialog. This method defines what
    each of the options means to each of the individual virtual machines
    or cloud instances for the service. This method is called from a
    service provisioning instance in the Automate model.

4.  Create an instance in the
    `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template`
    class that calls the method.

    **Note:**

    DOMAIN must be a user-defined Domain and not the locked ManageIQ Domain. If necessary, you can copy the class from the ManageIQ domain into a custom domain.

5.  Associate method with Automate instance.

6.  Create a **Catalog Bundle**, adding each of the catalog items to it.
    Select the **Service Dialog** you created. Use the instance created
    in the
    `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template`
    class as the **Entry Point**. Check **Display in Catalog** box.

7.  Provision a service.

#### Creating a Catalog Bundle

1.  Navigate to menu:Services\[Catalogs\].

2.  Click the **Catalog Items** accordion.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png)(**Configuration**), and then

4.  Enter a name and description for the bundle. Select **Display in
    Catalog**.

5.  Select the required **Catalog**.

6.  Select the required **Dialog**.

7.  Select chargeback currency.

8.  Enter **Price / Month**.

9.  Select the provisioning and retirement entry points.

10. Select **Additional Tenants**.

11. Click on the **Resources** tab, then select the catalog item you
    want to add to the bundle from the **Add a Resource** dropdown.

12. Click **Add**.

A catalog bundle is created and visible in the **Service Catalog**
accordion.

**Note:**

You should also create and specify an Entry Point in the
`DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/Methods/CatalogBundle` class for each catalog item that is part of a bundle. If you do not, then the pre and post provision processing will occur for each item in the bundle in addition to processing for the **Catalog Bundle**. To set the entry point, go into each **Catalog Item** and check **Display in Catalog**.
Then, you will see the **Entry Point** field.

#### Copying a Catalog Bundle

1.  Navigate to menu:Services\[Catalogs\].

2.  Click the **Catalog Items** accordion.

### Orchestration Stacks

Cloud orchestration is a service that allows you to create, update, and manage cloud resources and their software components as a single unit and then deploy them in an automated, repeatable way through a template.
Templates use a human-readable syntax and can be defined in text files, thereby allowing users to check them into version control. Templates allow you to easily deploy and reconfigure infrastructure for applications within your cloud. A user can author the stack templates, or can upload them from other sources.

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} supports adding Amazon CloudFormation, OpenStack Heat, Microsoft Azure, VNF, and VMware vApp template type, and provides the ability to:

  - Inventory stacks and elements of each type into the
    {{ site.data.product.title_short }} VMDB.

  - Model the relationships of instances to their stacks, inclusive of the user interface. For example, selecting an instance within a region that is within a stack, the user interface shows this on the standard instance view.

  - Model the stack and its elements in the user interface.

**Note:**

When importing a template into {{ site.data.product.title_short }}, the selected elements are converted according to their type. For example, lists convert to list boxes, and single items convert to text boxes.

#### Creating an Orchestration Template
