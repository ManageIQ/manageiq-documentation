. Navigate to menu:Overview[Reports].
. Select *Custom Reports* from the *Import/Export* accordion.
. In the *Import* area, click *Browse* to select an import file. 
. To overwrite an existing report with the same menu name, select *Overwrite existing reports*.
. Click *Upload* to import the report to the *Company-Custom* folder.
