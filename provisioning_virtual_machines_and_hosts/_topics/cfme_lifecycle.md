## Provisioning

When a virtual machine or cloud instance is provisioned, it goes through
multiple phases. First, the request must be made. The request includes
ownership information, tags, virtual hardware requirements, the
operating system, and any customization of the request. Second, the
request must go through an approval phase, either automatic or manual.
Finally, the request is executed. This part of provisioning consists of
pre-processing and post-processing. Pre-processing acquires IP addresses
for the user, creates CMDB instances, and creates the virtual machine or
instance based on information in the request. Post-processing activates
the CMDB instance and emails the user. The steps for provisioning may be
modified at any time using {{ site.data.product.title_short }}. ![2314](../images/2314.png)
