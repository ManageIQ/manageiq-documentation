	<title>Automate Model</title>
	<para>
		The Automate model is arranged to provide an object oriented hierarchy to control automation functions. The model uses the following organizational units arranged in a hierarchy:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Datastore - The main organization unit that stores the entire model.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Domains - Domains act as collection of automation functions. Functions are executed depending on the order of Domain priority, which means a function in a Domain with a higher priority overrides the same functions specified in a lower-priority Domain. This allows CloudForms Management Engine to specify a core Domain (ManageIQ) but allow users to override automate functions with custom Domains. Each Domain contains a set of Namespaces.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Namespaces - Containers that organize and categorize functions of the model. Namespaces can contain child Namespaces as well as Classes.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Classes - Templates for a specific function of the model. Each Class uses a Schema to apply to Instances to populate with default values. Each class also can contain a set of methods.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Instances - An instance is a version of a class populated with initial configuration data. An instance can include a collection of any number of attributes, calls to methods, and relationships.
			</para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				Methods - Methods are functions within the model. Methods use Ruby code to execute various operations needed for a Class.
			</para>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
		CloudForms Management Engine contains a set of preconfigured Domains for users:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				ManageIQ - The core domain for CloudForms Management Engine Automate operations. This domain is locked with the following Namespaces:
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Cloud - General cloud instance lifecycle from provisioning, retirement, methods, email.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Control - Control contains email alerts for policy controls.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Infrastructure - General infrastructure VM lifecycle from provisioning, retirement, methods, email.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Service - Service lifecycle from provisioning, retirement, methods, email.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						System - System contains classes that can provide the start points for all <productname>CloudForms Management Engine</productname> Automate activities.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				RedHat - Domain containing advanced operations, specifically interactions with supported cloud and infrastructure providers. This domain is locked with the following Namespaces:
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Cloud - Red Hat-supported cloud instance lifecycle from provisioning, retirement, methods, email.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Infrastructure - Red Hat-supported cloud instance lifecycle from provisioning, retirement, methods, email.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Integration - Used to interface with systems outside of <productname>CloudForms Management Engine</productname>. Use this namespace to integrate with additional systems.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
		You can copy classes and instances from locked Domains into your own custom domains.
	</para>
	<note>
		<para>
			Red Hat does not recommend changing any of the existing classes or instances shipped with the product as this may hinder the operation of the <productname>CloudForms Management Engine</productname>. You can link to these methods using relationships.
