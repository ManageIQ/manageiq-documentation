	<title>Conditions</title>

		Conditions are tests performed on attributes of virtual machines. A condition can contain two elements, a scope, and an expression. The expression is mandatory, but the scope is optional. A scope is a general attribute that is quickly checked before evaluating a more complex expression. For example, you might use a scope to check the operating system, and use an expression to check for a specific set of applications or security patches that only apply to the operating system referenced in the scope. If no conditions, scope or expression, are defined for a policy, the policy is considered unconditional and returns a true value.
