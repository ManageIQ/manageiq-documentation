# Managing Virtual Machine Snapshots

A snapshot is a view of a virtual machine’s operating system and
applications on any or all available disks at a given point in time.
Take a snapshot of a virtual machine before you make a change to it that
may have unintended consequences. You can use a snapshot to return a
virtual machine to a previous state.

View virtual machines by infrastructure providers by navigating to
menu:Compute\[Infrastructure \> Providers\].
