Migrating the virtual machines involves the following key tasks:

. Mapping the resources of your VMware and Red Hat OpenStack Platform environments. See xref:Creating_an_infrastructure_mapping_for_{context}[].

. Checking for migration conditions with prerequisites. See xref:Checking_for_migration_prerequisites_{context}[].
. Creating and running a migration plan. See xref:Creating_a_migration_plan_in_cloudforms_{context}[].

Optionally, you can change the maximum number of concurrent migrations for conversion hosts or providers to control the migration process.

After you have created an infrastructure mapping, check for migration prerequisites.

If these conditions do not apply, you can create a migration plan. See xref:Creating_a_migration_plan_in_cloudforms_{context}[].
