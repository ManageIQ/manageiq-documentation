#### Updating Resources

Use the following methods to update attributes in a resource:

  - Update a resource via the `PUT` HTTP Method

  - Update a resource via a `POST` Method with an **edit** action.

  - Update a resource via the `PATCH` HTTP Method

While `PUT` is the common method, the `PATCH` mechanism gives better
control on which attribute to edit or add, and enables removal, which is
not available with the other two methods.
