= Providers

A provider is a server with software to manage multiple virtual machines that reside on multiple hosts.
menu:Infrastructure[Providers] displays the providers in your environment. 

The web interface uses virtual thumbnails to represent providers.
Each thumbnail contains four quadrants by default, which display basic information about each provider.
