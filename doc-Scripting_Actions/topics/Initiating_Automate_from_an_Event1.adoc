=== Initiating Automate from an Event

You can also use a {product-title} Policy Event to initiate automation. You can either use the provided Raise Automation Event action or create a custom automation action. The first case will start in the `/System/Process` class, but then go to the Event that initiated the Automate model in the `/System/Process/Event Class`. If you create your own custom action, it will start from the `/System/Process` class and then go to the `/System/Process/Request Class` instead.

occur when a virtual machine is created. You would use the Raise
Automation Event Action. There are instances in the `/System/Process/Event Class` for the following Events that you can
