{{ site.data.product.title }} supports operating with the OpenStack `admin` tenant.
When creating an OpenStack provider in {{ site.data.product.title }}, select the
OpenStack provider’s `admin` user because it is the default
administrator of the OpenStack `admin` tenant. When using the `admin`
credentials, a user in {{ site.data.product.title }} provisions into the `admin`
tenant, and sees images, networks, and instances that are associated
with the `admin` tenant.

<div class="note">

In OpenStack, you must add `admin` as a member of all tenants that users
want to access and use in {{ site.data.product.title_short }}.

See [Cloud
Tenants](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/5.0-beta/html-single/managing_infrastructure_and_inventory/index#tenants)
in *Managing Infrastructure and Inventory* for information on working
with OpenStack tenants (projects) in {{ site.data.product.title_short }}.

</div>

{% include openstack/tenant-mapping.md %}

<div class="note">

You can set whether {{ site.data.product.title }} should use the Telemetry service or
Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) for event monitoring. If you
choose Telemetry, you should first configure the **ceilometer** service
on the overcloud to store events. See [???](#openstack-events-oc) for
instructions.

For more information, see [OpenStack Telemetry
(ceilometer)](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/11/html/architecture_guide/components#comp-telemetry)
in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform *Architecture Guide*.

</div>

<div class="note">

To authenticate the provider using a self-signed Certificate Authority
(CA), configure the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance to trust the
certificate using the steps in [???](#app-self_signed_CA) before adding
the provider.

</div>

1.  Navigate to menu:Compute\[Clouds \> Providers\].

2.  Click ![1847](/images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then click
    ![1862](/images/1862.png) (**Add a New Cloud Provider**).

3.  Enter a **Name** for the provider.

4.  From the **Type** list, select **OpenStack**.

5.  Select the appropriate **API Version** from the list. The default is
    `Keystone v2`.

    If you select `Keystone v3`, enter the `Keystone V3 Domain ID` that
    {{ site.data.product.title }} should use. This is the domain of the user account
    you will be specifying later in the **Default** tab. If domains are
    not configured in the provider, enter **default**.

    <div class="note">

    Keystone API v3 is required to create cloud tenants on OpenStack
    cloud providers.

    </div>

    <div class="note">

    {% include openstack/osp-keystone-api-v3.md %}

    </div>

6.  Enter a region number in **Region**.

7.  Enter the appropriate **Zone** for the provider. If you do not
    specify a zone, it is set to `default`.

8.  (Optional) Enable tenant mapping by toggling the **Tenant Mapping
    Enabled** option to **Yes**. This synchronizes resources and users
    between the OpenStack cloud provider and {{ site.data.product.title_short }}. By
    default, tenant mapping is disabled.

9.  Select the appropriate **Zone** for the provider. By default, the
    zone is set to **default**.

    <div class="note">

    For more information, see the definition of host aggregates and
    availability zones in [OpenStack Compute
    (nova)](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/11/html/architecture_guide/components#comp-compute)
    in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform *Architecture Guide*.

    </div>

10. In the **Default** tab, under **Endpoints**, configure the host and
    authentication details of your OpenStack provider:

    1.  Select a **Security Protocol** method to specify how to
        authenticate the provider:

          - **SSL without validation**: Authenticate the provider
            insecurely using SSL.

          - **SSL**: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted
            Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider
            has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted
            Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required
            for this option. This is the recommended authentication
            method.

          - **Non-SSL**: Connect to the provider insecurely using only
            HTTP protocol, without SSL.

    2.  In **Hostname (or IPv4 or IPv6 address)**, enter the public IP
        or fully qualified domain name of the OpenStack Keystone
        service.

        <div class="note">

        The hostname required here is also the **OS\_AUTH\_URL** value
        in the **\~/overcloudrc** file generated by the director (see
        [Accessing the
        Overcloud](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/11/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/#sect-Accessing_the_Overcloud)
        in Red Hat OpenStack Platform *Director Installation and
        Usage*), or the **\~/keystonerc\_admin** file generated by
        Packstack (see [Evaluating OpenStack: Single-Node
        Deployment](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1127153)).

        </div>

    3.  In **API Port**, set the public port used by the OpenStack
        Keystone service. By default, OpenStack uses port 5000 for
        non-SSL security protocol. For SSL, API port is 13000 by
        default.

    4.  In the **Username** field, enter the name of a user in the
        OpenStack environment.

        <div class="important">

        In environments that use Keystone v3 authentication, the user
        must have the **admin** role for the relevant domain.

        </div>

    5.  In the **Password** field, enter the password for the user.

    6.  Click **Validate** to confirm {{ site.data.product.title }} can connect to the
        OpenStack provider.

11. Next, configure how {{ site.data.product.title }} should receive events from the
    OpenStack provider. Click the **Events** tab in the **Endpoints**
    section to start.

      - To use the Telemetry service of the OpenStack provider, select
        **Ceilometer**. Before you do so, the provider must first be
        configured accordingly. See [???](#openstack-events-oc) for
        details.

      - If you prefer to use the AMQP Messaging bus instead, or eventing
        is not enabled on Ceilometer, select **AMQP** and configure the
        following:

        1.  Select a **Security Protocol** method.

        2.  In **Hostname (or IPv4 or IPv6 address)** (of the **Events**
            tab, under **Endpoints**), enter the public IP or fully
            qualified domain name of the AMQP host.

        3.  In the **API Port**, set the public port used by AMQP. By
            default, OpenStack uses port 5672 for this.

        4.  In the **Username** field, enter the name of an OpenStack
            user with privileged access (for example, **admin**). Then,
            provide its corresponding password in the **Password**
            field.

        5.  Click **Validate** to confirm the credentials.

12. Click **Add** after configuring the cloud provider.

<div class="note">

  - To collect inventory and metrics from an OpenStack environment, the
    {{ site.data.product.title }} appliance requires that the adminURL endpoint for
    the OpenStack environment be on a non-private network. Hence, the
    OpenStack adminURL endpoint should be assigned an IP address other
    than `192.168.x.x`. Additionally, all the Keystone endpoints must be
    accessible, otherwise refresh will fail.

  - Collecting capacity and utilization data from an OpenStack cloud
    provider requires selecting the **Collect for All Clusters** option
    under **Configuration**, in the settings menu. For information, see
    [Capacity and Utilization
    Collections](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.5/html-single/general_configuration/#capacity-and-utilization-collections)
    in the *General Configuration Guide*.
