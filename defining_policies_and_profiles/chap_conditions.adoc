Conditions
----------

Conditions are tests performed on attributes of virtual machines. A
condition can contain two elements, a scope, and an expression. The
expression is mandatory, but the scope is optional. A scope is a general
attribute that is quickly checked before evaluating a more complex
expression. For example, you might use a scope to check the operating
system, and use an expression to check for a specific set of
applications or security patches that only apply to the operating system
referenced in the scope. If no conditions, scope or expression, are
defined for a policy, the policy is considered unconditional and returns
a true value.
