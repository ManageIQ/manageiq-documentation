# Removing Network Providers

Although network providers are added or
removed automatically upon adding or
removing the respective cloud provider, you
can manually remove a network provider if it
is no longer in use. This will remove the
network provider from the VMDB and any
relationship with the cloud provider.

1. Browse to menu: **Networks > Providers**.

2. Click the network provider to remove.

3. Click **Configuration**, and then
   ![Remove this Network Provider from the VMDB](../images/2098.png) **Remove this Network Provider from the VMDB**.

4. Click **OK**.
