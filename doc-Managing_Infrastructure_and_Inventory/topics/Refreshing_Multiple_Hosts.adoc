= Refreshing Multiple Hosts

Manually refresh a host for its properties and related infrastructure components. 

.Procedure: To Refresh Multiple Hosts
. Navigate to menu:Infrastructure[Hosts]. 
. Check the hosts to refresh. 
. Click  image:images/1847.png[] btn:[(Configuration)], and then  image:images/2003.png[] btn:[(Refresh Relationships and Power States)]. 
. Click [label]#OK#. 

.Result:
When a host is refreshed and a new virtual machine is discovered on that host, CloudForms Management Engine checks to see if the virtual machine is already registered with another host.
If this is the case, the host that the virtual machine is associated with switches to the new host.
If the SmartProxy is monitoring a provider, this happens automatically.
If not, the next refresh of the host addresses this.
