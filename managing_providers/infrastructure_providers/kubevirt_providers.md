# KubeVirt Providers

KubeVirt is a virtualization layer which allows Virtual Machines to be managed along side containers using standard Kubernetes utilities.

In order to add a KubeVirt provider to ManageIQ you must first have a Kubernetes or OpenShift provider and then add a Virtualization endpoint.

Once added you should see VMs, Hosts, Clusters, and Storages like any other Infrastructure provider.
