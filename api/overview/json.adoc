=== General Conventions

The API uses http://www.json.org[JSON] throughout; the
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/4_Content-Type.html[Content-Type]
for all requests and responses is *application/json*.

As is general practice with REST, clients should not make assumptions
about the server's URL space. Clients are expected to discover all URL's
by navigating the API. To keep this document readable, we still mention
specific URL's, generally in the form of an absolute path. Clients
should not use these, or assume that the actual URL structure follows
these examples, and instead use discovered URL's. Any client should
start its discovery with the API entry point, here denoted with */api*.

[[basic-types]]
=== Basic types

The following are basic data types and type combinators that are used
throughout:

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Name |Explanation |Example serialization
|*Integer* |Integer value|{ "id" : 10 }
|*String* |JSON string |{ "state" : "running" }
|*URL* |Absolute URL |{ "href" : "http://SERVER/vms/1/start" }
|*Timestamp* |Timestamp in ISO8601 format |{ "created" : "2013-12-05T08:15:30Z" }
|*Array[T]* |Array where each entry has type T |{ "vms" : [ { "id" : 1 }, { "id" : 2 }] }
|*Ref[T]* |A reference to a T, used to model relations, the T is a valid Resource identifier |{ "vm" : { "href" : URL } }
|*Collection* |Array[T] where T represents a Ref[T], this might allow actions to be executed on all members as a single unit |{ "vms" : { "count" : 2, "resources" : [ { "href" : URL}, { "href" : URL } ], "actions" : [] }
|*Struct* |A structure with sub-attributes |"power_state": {"state" : "ON", "last_boot_time" : "2013-05-29T15:28Z", "state_change_time" : "2013-05-29T15:28Z"}
|=======================================================================

[[common-attributes-and-actions]]
=== Common Attributes and Actions

The following describes attributes and actions that are shared by all
resources and collections defined in this API.

[[attributes]]
==== Attributes

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|======================================================================
|Attribute | Type | Description
|id | Integer | An integer identifier for the referenced resource
|href | Ref(self) | A unique self reference
|name | String | A human name of the resource
|======================================================================


[source,json]
----
{
  "id" : 10,
  "href" : "http://localhost:3000/api/vms/10",
  "name" : "first_vm"
}
----

[[actions]]
=== Actions

[cols="<,<,<",options="header",]
|======================================================================
|Action | HTTP method | Description
|create | POST | Create new resource in the collection
|edit | PUT/PATCH/POST | Edit attributes in resource
|delete | DELETE | Delete resource
|======================================================================

[NOTE]
.About permissions and security:
====

Advertising of the common actions depends purely on the role and permissions
of that the current API user does have for the particular resource.
====

[[collections]]
=== Collections

Resources can be grouped into collections. Each collection is homogeneous so
that it contains only one type of resource, and unordered. Resources can also
exist outside any collection. In this case, we refer to these resources as
singleton resources. Collections are themselves resources as well.

Collections can exist globally, at the top level of an API, but can also be
contained inside a single resource. In the latter case, we refer to these
collections as sub-collections. Sub-collections are usually used to express some
kind of “contained in” relationship

Collections are serialized in JSON in the following way:

[source,json]
----
{
  "name" : String,
  "count": Integer,
  "subcount": Integer,
  "resources": [ ... ],
  "actions": [ ... ]
}
----

Where the *name* attribute is the collection name.  The
*count* attribute in a collection always denotes the total number of items in the
collection, not the number of items returned. *subcount* attribute in a collection
depicts the number of items returned.
Then the *resources* attribute is an Array[T] where T might be a list of
references to the T or, if expanded a list of resources with all attributes.
The *actions* then contains an Array of actions that can be performed against
the collection resources.

[[action-specification]]
=== Action Specification

The representation of each resource will only contain an action and its URL
if the current user is presently allowed to perform that action against that
resource. Actions will be contained in the *actions* attribute of a
resource; that attribute contains an array of action definition, where each
action definition has a rel, method and a href attribute.

* *name* attribute contains the action name
* *method* attribute states the HTTP method that must be used in a client
  HTTP request in order to perform the given action
  (eg. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* *href* attribute contains the absolute URL that the HTTP request should
  be performed against
* *form* an optional attribute that references a JSON document which describes
  the resource attributes that can be provided in the message body when performing
  this action. This description will indicate which of those attributes are mandatory
  and which are optional.

[[collection-actions]]
=== Collection actions

The actions performed against a collection of resources, are in most cases
batch operations against multiple resources. The action request must include an
HTTP body with the action name and the list of resource representations that the
action will be performed against.

The resource representation might include the resource attributes as they can
change the way how the action is actually performed. In the example below, the
first service is retired immediately, versus the second being retired at a later date
with a retirement warning of 3 days.

Sample JSON request body for collection action:

----
POST /api/services
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "action": "retire",
  "resources" : [
    { "href" : "http://localhost:3000/api/services/101" },
    { "href" : "http://localhost:3000/api/services/102",
      "date" : "10/30/2015",
      "warn" : 3
    }
  ]
}
----

Actions in collection:

[source,json]
----
{
  "name" : String,
  "count": Integer,
  "resources": [ ... ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "name"   : "start",
      "method" : "post",
      "href"   : URL
    },
    {
      "name"   : "stop",
      "method" : "post",
      "href"   : URL
    },
    {
      "name"   : "suspend",
      "method" : "post",
      "href"   : URL
    },
    {
      "name"    : "edit",
      "method" : "post",
      "href"   : URL
    },
    {
      "name"    : "delete",
      "method" : "post",
      "href"   : URL
    },
    {
      "name"   : "delete",
      "method" : "delete",
      "href"   : URL
    }
  ]
}
----

[[resource-actions]]
=== Resource actions

An action performed against a given resource is always described in the
body of the HTTP request. The HTTP body could contain a list of resource
attributes that dictate how the state of the receiving resource is to be
changed once the action is performed. At minimum the JSON document in the
message body must contain the name of the action to be performed.

In cases where no attributes are required to perform an action the HTTP body
will contain an empty JSON document, in which case default values will be assigned
to the corresponding attributes.

Sample JSON request body for resource action:

----
POST /api/services/101
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "action"   : "retire",
  "resource" : { "date" : "10/30/2015", "warn" : 5 }
}
----


----
POST /api/vms/321
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "action"   : "start",
  "resource" : {}
}
----

or Simply:

[source,json]
----
{
  "action"   : "start"
}
----

Actions in a resource:

[source,json]
----
{
  "id"    : Integer,
  "href"  : Ref(self),
  "name"  : "resource human name",
  "actions" : [
    {
      "name"   : "edit",
      "method" : "post",
      "href"   : URL
    }
  ]
}
----

[[action-responses]]
=== Action Responses

When performing actions on resources, there are two types of responses that
one is to expect.

1. For actions that operate on the resource itself like a _create_ or _edit_, the
response is usually the updated resource. This includes creation of Provision or
Automate requests where the created /api/provision_requests and
/api/automation_requests gets returned.

2. For others like a _start_ or _stop_ action, the response includes an action result
for each targetted resource. An action result has the following construct in
the response:

[source,json]
----
{
  "results" : [
    {
      "success" : true | false,
      "message" : String,
      "href" : Ref[resource],
      "result" : Struct,
      "task_id" : Id,
      "task_href" : Ref[task]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
----

results being an array of action results as one or more resources could
be targeted in a request.

NOTE:
* success and message are always there.
* result is optional and would exist when an action results in data, i.e. policy resolve.
* href is populated for the resource being targeted by the action
* task_id and task_href are optional. They are defined when actions are run
asynchronously and a task is created, i.e. http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/:id which
can be monitored for action completion.

Other action specific attributes could also be returned in the the action result.

For tagging actions:

[source,json]
----
{
  "tag_category" : String,
  "tag_name" : String,
  "tag_href" : Ref[tags]
}
----

When executing actions on subcollections, like _policies_, _policy_profiles_
and _service_templates_, the following is also provided in the action
result:

[source,json]
----
{
  "<subcollection>_id" : Id,
  "<subcollection>_href" : Ref[subcollection]
}
----
