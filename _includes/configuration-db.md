### Configuring an Internal Database

Before installing an internal database, add a disk to the infrastructure
hosting your appliance. See the documentation specific to your
infrastructure for instructions for adding a disk. As a storage disk
usually cannot be added while a virtual machine is running, Red Hat
recommends adding the disk before starting the appliance.
{{ site.data.product.title_short }} only supports installing of an internal VMDB on blank
disks; installation will fail if the disks are not blank.

</div>

1.  Start the appliance and open a terminal console.

2.  Enter the `appliance_console` command. The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance
    summary screen displays.

3.  Press **Enter** to manually configure settings.

4.  Select **Configure Application** from the menu.

5.  You are prompted to create or fetch an encryption key.

      - If this is the first {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance, choose **Create
        key**.

      - If this is not the first {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance, choose
        **Fetch key from remote machine** to fetch the key from the
        first appliance. For worker and multi-region setups, use this
        option to copy key from another appliance.

        **Note:**

        All {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliances in a multi-region
        deployment must use the same key.

6.  Choose **Create Internal Database** for the database location. 

    In the **Configure Messaging** menu, select **Make No messaging changes**. If you see ```Configuration failed: Internal database require a volume mounted at /var/lib/pgsql. Please add an unpartitioned disk and try again.``` message, then ensure to add a second disk for the database per instructions as defined above.

7.  Choose a disk for the database. This can be either a disk you
    attached previously, or a partition on the current disk.

    <div class="important">

    Red Hat recommends using a separate disk for the database.

    </div>

    If there is an unpartitioned disk attached to the virtual machine,
    the dialog will show options similar to the following:

        1) /dev/vdb: 20480
        2) Don't partition the disk

      - Enter **1** to choose `/dev/vdb` for the database location. This
        option creates a logical volume using this device and mounts the
        volume to the appliance in a location appropriate for storing
        the database. The default location is `/var/lib/pgsql`, which
        can be found in the environment variable
        `$APPLIANCE_PG_MOUNT_POINT`.

      - Enter **2** to continue without partitioning the disk. A second
        prompt will confirm this choice. Selecting this option results
        in using the root filesystem for the data directory (not advised
        in most cases).

8.  Enter **Y** or **N** for **Should this appliance run as a standalone
    database server?**

      - Select **Y** to configure the appliance as a database-only
        appliance. As a result, the appliance is configured as a basic
        PostgreSQL server, without a user interface.

      - Select **N** to configure the appliance with the full
        administrative user interface.

9.  When prompted, enter a unique number to create a new region.

    <div class="important">

    Creating a new region destroys any existing data on the chosen
    database.

    </div>

10. Create and confirm a password for the database.

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} then configures the internal database. This takes a few
minutes. After the database is created and initialized, you can log in
to {{ site.data.product.title_short }}.

#### Configuring an External Database

Based on your setup, you will choose to configure the appliance to use
an external PostgreSQL database. For example, we can only have one
database in a single region. However, a region can be segmented into
multiple zones, such as database zone, user interface zone, and
reporting zone, where each zone provides a specific function. The
appliances in these zones must be configured to use an external
database.

The `postgresql.conf` file used with {{ site.data.product.title_short }} databases requires
specific settings for correct operation. For example, it must correctly
reclaim table space, control session timeouts, and format the PostgreSQL
server log for improved system support. It is recommended that external databases use a
`postgresql.conf` file based on the standard file used by the
{{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance.

Ensure you configure the settings in the `postgresql.conf` to suit your
system. For example, customize the `shared_buffers` setting according to
the amount of real storage available in the external system hosting the
PostgreSQL instance. In addition, depending on the aggregate number of
appliances expected to connect to the PostgreSQL instance, it may be
necessary to alter the `max_connections` setting.

**Note:**

  - {{ site.data.product.title_short }} requires PostgreSQL version 10.

  - Because the `postgresql.conf` file controls the operation of all
    databases managed by a single instance of PostgreSQL, do not mix
    {{ site.data.product.title_short }} databases with other types of databases in a single
    PostgreSQL instance.

1.  Start the appliance and open a terminal console.

2.  Enter the `appliance_console` command. The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance
    summary screen displays.

3.  Press **Enter** to manually configure settings.

4.  Select **Configure Application** from the menu.

5.  Choose **Create Region in External Database** for the database location.

6.  Enter the database hostname or IP address when prompted.

7.  Enter the database name or leave blank for the default
    (`vmdb_production`).

8.  Enter the database username or leave blank for the default (`root`).

9. Enter the chosen database userâ€™s password.

10. Confirm the configuration if prompted.

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} will then configure the external database.
