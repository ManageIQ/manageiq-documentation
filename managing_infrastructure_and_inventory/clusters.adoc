Clusters provide high availability and load balancing for a group of hosts.
The *Clusters* page under *Infrastructure* displays the clusters discovered in your enterprise environment.

Use the *Clusters Taskbar* to manage the analysis and tagging of your clusters.
These buttons manage multiple clusters at one time.
To manage one cluster, click on that cluster in the main area of the screen.

= Comparing Clusters

{product-title} provides features to compare properties of clusters.

. Navigate to menu:Infrastructure[Clusters].
. Check the clusters to compare.
. Click  image:images/1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and then  image:images/2148.png[] (*Compare selected Clusters*).
  The comparison displays in a default expanded view and lists a limited set of properties.

. To delete a cluster from the comparison, click  image:images/1861.png[](*Remove this Cluster from the Comparison*).
. To go to a compressed view, click  image:images/2024.png[] (*Compressed View*).
  To return to an expanded view, click  image:images/2023.png[] (*Expanded View*).
. To change the base cluster that all other clusters compare to, click its label at the top of its column.
. To go to the cluster summary screen, click its virtual thumbnail or icon.
. There are three buttons in the taskbar to limit the type of views:
+
* Click  image:images/2178.png[] (*All attributes*) to see all attributes.
* Click  image:images/2204.png[] (*Attributes with different values*) to see only the attributes that are different across clusters.
* Click  image:images/2148.png[] (*Attributes with the same values*) to see only the attributes that are the same across clusters.

. To limit the mode of the view, there are two taskbar buttons.
+
* Click  image:images/2022.png[] (*Details Mode*) to see all details for an attribute.
* Click  image:images/2025.png[] (*Exists Mode*) to only see if an attribute exists compared to the base or not.
  This only applies to attributes that can have a Boolean property.
  For example, a user account exists or does not exist, or a piece of hardware that does or does not exist.


This creates a comparison between clusters.
Export this data or create a report from your comparison for analysis using external tools.
