== Introduction

Satellite 6 is a subscription and system management tool that provides a way to provision hosts (both virtual and bare metal) and configure them using a set of Puppet modules. Red Hat CloudForms 3.2 provides functionality to integrate with a Red Hat Satellite 6 server and take advantage of its features. This includes:

* Monitoring the inventory of your Red Hat Satellite 6 server, including independent hosts and hosts provisioned using hostgroups.
* Reprovisioning existing bare mental systems hosts to new host groups.
* Applying Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine policy tags to hosts.

This guide provides a step-by-step workflow on how to integrate Red Hat CloudForms 4.0 and Red Hat Satellite 6 together.
