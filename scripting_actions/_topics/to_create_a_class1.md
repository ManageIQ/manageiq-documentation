### Creating a Class

1.  Navigate to **Automation > Automate > Explorer**, navigate to the
    namespace you want to add a class to.

2.  Click ![image](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then
    ![image](../images/1862.png) (**Add a new Class**).

3.  Type in a unique **Name** and **Description**.

4.  If you want to use the schema from a class that has already been
    created, select it from the **Inherits From** dropdown. If the class
    that the new class inherits from changes, the new class will also
    change.

5.  Click **Add**.

The new class is created and you can create a schema, add instances and
methods.

**Note:**

For each class, create a schema if you did not choose to inherit from an
existing class. The schema can include attributes, methods, assertions,
and relationships.
