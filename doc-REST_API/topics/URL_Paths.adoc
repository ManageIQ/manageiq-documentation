==== URL Paths

The recommended convention for URLs is to use alternative collection or resource path segments, relative to the API entry point as described in the following example: 

[cols=",",options="header",]
|====
|URL |Description
|/api |The REST API Entrypoint
|/api/v**Version** |The REST Entrypoint for a specific version of the REST API
|/api/:collection |A top-level collection
|/api/:collection/:id |A specific resource of that collection
|/api/:collection/:id/:subcollection |Sub-collection under the specific resource
