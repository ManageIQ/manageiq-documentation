== Usage

Usage provides a targeted view of CPU, RAM, disk space, disk I/O, and network I/O for tagged virtual machines.
This allows you to find which virtual machines are using or overusing resources.

There are two requirements to use this feature:

* You must assign tags to the virtual machines that you want to collect usage data for.
