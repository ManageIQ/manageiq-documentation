### Copying a Report

Use this feature to copy a report that is similar to one that you want
to create. By copying a report, you only need to make minor edits
instead of creating an entirely new report.

1.  Navigate to **Overview > Reports**.

2.  Click the **Reports > All Reports** accordion and select the
    report that you want to copy.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then click
    ![1859](../images/1859.png) (**Copy this report**).

4.  On the Columns tab, edit the **Basic Report Info** area to include a
    new **Menu Name**. Each **Menu Name** must be unique.

5.  Make any other changes you need. See "Adding a Report" for details
    on the changes you can make.

6.  Click **Add**.
