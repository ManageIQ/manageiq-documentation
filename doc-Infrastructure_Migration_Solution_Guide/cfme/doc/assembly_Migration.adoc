= Migrating the infrastructure

Migrating your infrastructure comprises 2 tasks:

* xref:Creating_an_Infrastructure_Mapping[Mapping] the resources (clusters, datastores, and networks) of your source environment to your target environment and selecting virtual machines to migrate

* Creating a xref:Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[migration plan] with optional xref:Automating_pre_and_post_migration_tasks_with_ansible[automated tasks] that run before or after each virtual machine is migrated
+
You can xref:Canceling_a_migration_plan[cancel] a migration plan that is in progress. This option allows you to retry the migration plan immediately or to schedule it in the future.
