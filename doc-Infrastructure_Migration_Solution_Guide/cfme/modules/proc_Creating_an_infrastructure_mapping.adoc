= Creating an infrastructure mapping

ifdef::rhv[]
The infrastructure mapping maps the resources of your VMware and Red Hat Virtualization environments.
endif::rhv[]
ifdef::osp[]
The infrastructure mapping maps the resources of your VMware and Red Hat OpenStack Platform environments.
endif::osp[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you add or remove providers or provider objects from an infrastructure mapping, the mapping will have missing resource errors. You must delete the infrastructure mapping and create a new one.

.Procedure

. Click menu:Compute[Migration > Infrastructure Mappings].
. Click *Create Infrastructure Mapping*. The *Create Infrastructure Mapping* wizard is displayed.

. In the *General* screen, add the infrastructure mapping details:

.. Enter the infrastructure mapping *Name* and (optional) *Description*.
.. Select the *Target Provider*.
.. Click *Next*.

. In the *Map Compute* screen, map the source and target clusters:

ifdef::rhv[]
.. Select a *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Cluster* and a *Target Provider \ Datacenter \ Cluster*.
+
If the target cluster does not contain a conversion host, a warning icon (image:warning.png[height=15px]) appears. You can create and save an infrastructure mapping, but you must configure the conversion hosts before running a migration plan.

.. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map additional clusters.
endif::rhv[]
ifdef::osp[]
.. Select a *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Cluster* source cluster and a *Target Provider \ Project*.
+
If the target project does not contain a conversion host, a warning icon (image:warning.png[height=15px]) appears. You can create and save an infrastructure mapping, but you must configure the conversion hosts before running a migration plan.

.. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map additional projects.
endif::osp[]
.. Click *Next*.

. In the *Map Storage* screen, map the source and target storage:

ifdef::rhv[]
.. Select a *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Datastore* and *Target Datastores*.
endif::rhv[]
ifdef::osp[]
.. Select a *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Datastore* and *Target Provider \ Volume Type*.
+
If the volume type is missing, check that the volume type has been set. Block storage requires at least one volume type. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/storage_guide/#section-create-volume[Create a Volume] and link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/14/html-single/storage_guide/#section-volume-retype[Changing a Volumeâ€™s Type (Volume Re-typing)] in the _Red Hat OpenStack Platform Storage Guide_.
endif::osp[]

.. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map additional datastores.
.. Click *Next*.

. In the *Map Networks* screen, map the source and target networks:

.. Select a source cluster from the drop-down list.
.. Select one or more networks from *Source Provider \ Datacenter \ Network* and *Target Project \ Network*.
ifdef::osp[]
+
IMS supports both provider and tenant networks.
endif::osp[]

.. Click *Add Mapping*. You can map the networks of additional source clusters.
.. Click *Create*.

. In the *Results* screen, click *Close*. The infrastructure mapping is saved in menu:Compute[Migration > Infrastructure Mappings].

You can click an infrastructure mapping element to view its details:
