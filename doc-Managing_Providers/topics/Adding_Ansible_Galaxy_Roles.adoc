=== Installing Roles on an Embedded Ansible Appliance 

Roles are ways of automatically loading certain variable files, tasks, and handlers based on a known file structure. Grouping content by roles also allows easy sharing of roles with other users. 
Install roles on a {product-title} appliance with the Embedded Ansible server role activated to optimize playbooks. 


When using this role in a playbook on a {product-title_short} appliance, add an empty `roles` directory at the root of the playbook. In the `roles` directory, include a `requirements.yml` file with the following contents:
 
-----
---
- src: <ansible-galaxy-role>
-----

{product-title_short} will automatically install the role once it sees the `requirements.yml` file in the playbook.
