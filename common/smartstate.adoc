After enabling the required server roles, enable SmartState analysis. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/support_matrix/#smart_state_analysis_support[Smart State Analysis Support] from the Support Matrix and https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/managing_providers/#running-a-smartstate-analysis[Running a SmartState Analysis] in the _Managing Providers_ guide for more information.

Enabling SmartState analysis is similar to xref:cf-caputils[], in that the procedure also involves enabling server roles on a specific server. To do so:

. Click i*Configuration*.
. Select the server to configure from menu:Settings[Zone] in the left pane of the appliance.
. Navigate to the *Server Roles* list in the menu:Server[Server Control] section. From there, set the appropriate SmartState roles to *ON*. Namely:
.. *SmartProxy*
.. *SmartState Analysis*
. Click *Save*.
