== Configuring Automatic Tagging for Container Entities

Container object labels in OpenShift can be used to automatically create tags and tag categories in {product-title}. This is done by mapping {product-title} tags to existing OpenShift or Kubernetes labels.

Labels from OpenShift can be mapped to {product-title} tags for the following container entities:

* Projects
* Nodes
* Routes
* Replicators
* Container services
* Pods
* Container builds

[NOTE]
====
Tags automatically created from OpenShift labels are completely managed by the {product-title} system and cannot be manually assigned or unassigned. Deleting a mapping rule from {product-title} immediately deletes the resulting tags.
====

You can view a container entity's OpenShift labels on the entity's details page under *Labels*. 

The following example shows how to configure tagging for a node, but the same steps can be used for mapping labels to tags on other container entities.

To configure automatic tagging on container entities using labels:

. Note the _key_ of the OpenShift label you want to map to a {product-title} tag. OpenShift labels consist of two parts: a _key_ and a _value_.
.. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Nodes].
.. Select a node to open its summary page.
.. Under *Labels*, note the label(s) to map to {product-title} tag(s). Any OpenShift labels will list the _key_ in the left column of the *Labels* table, and the _value_ in the right column of the *Labels* table.
+
This node has six labels (key/value pairs) that were created in OpenShift and collected in the {product-title} inventory:

[NOTE]
====
To create an OpenShift label, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html[Developer CLI Operations] in the OpenShift Container Platform _CLI Reference_ guide. A new label added in OpenShift will only show up in {product-title} after the next OpenShift provider refresh.

. Navigate to *Configuration* and select the region.
. Click the *Map Tags* tab.
. Click *Add* to create a new mapping rule.
.. Select a container entity to tag from the *Entity* list, or select *<All>* to tag all entities.
.. Specify the _key_ from the OpenShift label you noted earlier in the *Label* field. 
.. Specify a {product-title} tag category in *Category* to map the label to. If the tag category does not exist yet in {product-title}, it will be created automatically.

+
.. Click *Add*.
The mapping will show in the table on the *Map Tags* tab.
+
. Refresh the provider to complete the mapping:
.. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Providers].
.. Select the provider to refresh.
.. Click  image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and then  image:2003.png[] (*Refresh Items and Relationships*).

The label will display on the entity's summary page under *Smart Management* under *Company Tags* as `<Category> : <value>`.

Any container entity with the OpenShift `zone` label will be tagged automatically as `category1` in {product-title}. If the _value_ for `zone` is `south`, for example, the entity will be tagged as `category1 : south`.

You can use these tags to create reports. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.2/single/monitoring-alerts-and-reporting/[Monitoring, Alerts, and Reporting] for details on creating reports.
