= Usage

Usage provides a targeted view of CPU, RAM, disk space, disk I/O, and network I/O for tagged virtual machines.
This allows you to find which virtual machines are using or overusing resources. 

There are two requirements to use this feature: 

* You must assign tags to the virtual machines that you want to collect usage data for.
  See section https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_CloudForms/4.0/html/Insight_Guide/sect-Virtual_Machines.html#To_tag_Virtual_Machines_and_Templates[Tagging Virtual Machines and Templates] in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_CloudForms/4.0/html/Insight_Guide/index.html[Red Hat CloudForms 4.0 Insight Guide]. 
* Capacity and utilization collection must be enabled.
  For more information on configuring capacity and utilization charts, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_CloudForms/4.0/html/User_Guide/index.html[Red Hat CloudForms 4.0 User Guide].
