= Middleware Providers

In {product-title}, a middleware provider is a middleware management environment that you can add to a {product-title} appliance to manage and interact with the resources in that environment. This chapter describes the different types of middleware providers that you can add to {product-title}, and how to manage them.

== Middleware Management

The middleware provider extends {product-title} management capabilities to JBoss Middleware application containers running in managed virtual machines, hosts, and Linux containers. The provider delivers inventory, events, metrics, and power operations. Middleware management in {product-title} is a provider based on the Hawkular open source project.  When feature complete, the Middleware Management provider will replace the current Red Hat middleware management offering, JBoss Operations Network.
