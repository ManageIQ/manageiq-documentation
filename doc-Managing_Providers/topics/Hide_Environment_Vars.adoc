= Hiding Environment Variables for Containers Providers

You can restrict users from viewing container provider environment variables by configuring user roles. 

This is useful as the environment variables panel can expose sensitive information, such as passwords, that you may not want certain users to view. 

[NOTE]
======
The default user roles in {product-title_short} are read-only. To customize a role's settings, create a new role or a copy of an existing role. 
======

You can view role information and the product features the role can access (marked by a checkmark) by clicking on any role in *Access Control*. Expand the categories under *Product Features* to see further detail.

To configure user access to container environment variables:

. Click image:config-gear.png[] (*Configuration*).
. Click the *Access Control* accordion, then click *Roles*.
. Select a existing custom role from the *Access Control Roles* list, and click image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), then image:1851.png[] (*Edit the selected Role*). 
+
Alternatively, to create a new custom role, select a role from the *Access Control Roles* list, and click image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), then image:1851.png[] (*Copy this Role to a new Role*).
. Edit the name for the role if desired.
. For *Access Restriction for Services, VMs, and Templates*, select if you want to limit users with this role to only see resources owned by the user or their group, owned by the user, or all resources (*None*).
. Expand the *Product Features (Editing)* tree options to show menu:Everything[Compute > Containers > Containers Explorer > All Containers > View Containers].
. Clear the *Environment Variables* checkbox to restrict the user role from viewing container environment variables.
