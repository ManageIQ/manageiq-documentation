[[Overview]]
== Environment Overview

This guide describes how to configure and manage database high availability in a {product-title} environment. This configuration allows for disaster mitigation: a failure in the primary database does not result in downtime, as the standby database takes over the failed databaseâ€™s processes. This is made possible by database replication between two or more database servers. In {product-title_short}, these servers are _database-only {product-title_short} appliances_ which do not have `evmserverd` processes enabled. 

In this configuration, only one database is writable at any given time. This procedure also does not provide scalability or a multi-master database setup. While a {product-title} environment is comprised of an engine tier and a database tier, this configuration affects only the database tier and does not provide load balancing for the appliances.

This guide describes two types of appliances used in high availability: 

* _Database-only {product-title_short} appliances_, which do not have `evmserverd` processes enabled or a user interface.
* _{product-title_short} appliances_, which are standard appliances containing a user interface and which have `evmserverd` processes enabled.


[NOTE]
====
Manual steps are required to reintroduce the failed database node back as the standby server. See xref:reintroducing_the_failed_node[].

=== Requirements

For a high availability {product-title} environment, you need a virtualization host containing at minimum four virtual machines with {product-title_short} installed, consisting of:

- One virtual machine for the primary external database containing a minimum of 4GB dedicated disk space
- One virtual machine for the standby external database containing a minimum of 4GB dedicated disk space
- Two virtual machines for the {product-title_short} appliances

See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.2/paged/deployment-planning-guide/chapter-2-planning[Planning] in the _Deployment Planning Guide_ for information on setting up the correct disk space for the database-only appliances.

The database-only appliances should reside on a highly reliable local network in the same location.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is essential to use the same {product-title} appliance template version to install each virtual machine in this environment.

See the https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-cloudforms[Red Hat Customer Portal] to obtain the appliance download for the platform you are running {product-title_short} on.

====

Correct time synchronization is required before installing the cluster. After installing the appliances, configure time synchronization on all appliances using `chronyd`.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends using a DNS server for a high availability configuration, as DNS names can be updated more quickly than IP addresses when restoring an operation in a different location, network, or datacenter.
