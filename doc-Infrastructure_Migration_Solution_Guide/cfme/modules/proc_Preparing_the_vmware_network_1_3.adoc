= Preparing the VMware network

ifdef::rhv[]
.Procedure

. Extend the VMware network to the Red Hat Virtualization environment.
. Ensure that the VMware network provides high throughput (10 GbE) and does not affect production virtual machines (for example, a backup network).
endif::rhv[]

ifdef::osp[]
Extend the VMware network to the Red Hat OpenStack Platform environment.
endif::osp[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The network configuration must not be changed in any way during the migration.
* IP addresses, VLANs, and other network configuration must not be changed before or after migration because the conversion process preserves the source virtual machine MAC addresses.
