= Usage

Usage provides a targeted view of CPU, RAM, disk space, disk I/O, and network I/O for tagged virtual machines.
This allows you to find which virtual machines are using or overusing resources.

There are two requirements to use this feature:

* You must assign tags to the virtual machines that you want to collect usage data for.
  See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/version-4.0/managing-infrastructure-and-inventory/#to_tag_virtual_machines_and_templates[Tagging Virtual Machines and Templates] in *Managing Infrastructure and Inventory*.
* Capacity and utilization collection must be enabled.
  For more information on configuring capacity and utilization charts, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/version-4.0/deployment-planning-guide/#Capacity_Planning[Capacity Planning] chapter in the *Deployment Planning Guide*.
