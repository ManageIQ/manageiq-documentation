= Infrastructure Migration Solution Overview

Red Hat's Infrastructure Migration Solution (IMS) enables you to migrate your virtual machines from VMware to Red Hat Virtualization or to Red Hat OpenStack Platform.

link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.2/[Red Hat Virtualization] (RHV) is an enterprise-grade virtualization platform built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. With Red Hat Virtualization, you can manage your entire virtual infrastructure, including hosts, virtual machines, networks, storage, and users, from a centralized graphical user interface or with a REST API.

link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/[Red Hat OpenStack Platform] (OpenStack) provides the foundation to build a private or public Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It offers a massively scalable, fault-tolerant platform for the development of cloud-enabled workloads.

The IMS user interface, link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red-hat-cloudforms[Red Hat CloudForms], provides the control and automation required to manage challenging enterprise environments.

Currently, IMS supports only cold migration. The virtual machines are powered off gracefully as part of the migration process.

.IMS Phases

The Infrastructure Migration Solution has 4 key phases:

. Planning the migration:
.. Consult the xref:Planning_questions[planning questions] to ensure that you have sufficient resources for the migration.
.. Follow xref:Best_practices_for_migration[best practices] to minimize the impact on your users. You may choose to schedule the migration in phases or to create groups of virtual machines that should migrate together.

. Preparing the migration environment:
.. Create and configure the xref:Preparing_the_source_and_target_environments[source and target environments].
.. Create and configure the xref:Preparing_the_rhv_conversion_hosts[RHV conversion host(s)].

. Migrating the infrastructure:
.. xref:Creating_an_Infrastructure_Mapping[Map] your source environment to the target environment, selecting the virtual machines to migrate.
.. Create and run a xref:Creating_and_running_a_migration_plan[migration plan], with optional automated pre- and post-migration tasks.

. Verifying the migration:
.. Check the completed migration plan for successfully migrated virtual machines.
.. If errors appear, see xref:Troubleshooting[].
