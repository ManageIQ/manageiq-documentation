Before you can access and apply package updates, you must register and subscribe the {product-title} appliance to either Red Hat Content Delivery Network (CDN) or to a Red Hat Satellite server.

You need the following to register your appliance:

* Your Red Hat account login or Red Hat Network Satellite login
* A Red Hat subscription that covers your product

To register your appliance with Red Hat Subscription Management or Red Hat Satellite 6, first configure the region with your registration details. These settings will apply to all appliances in this region.

To configure registration for a region:

. Log in to the appliance as the `admin` user.
. Click image:config-gear.png[Configuration](*Configuration*).
. Select *Region* in the accordion menu and click the *Red Hat Updates* tab.
. Click *Edit Registration*.
. Configure registration details for the {product-title} appliance using one of two available options:
.. To register with Red Hat Subscription Management:
... In *Register to*, select *Red Hat Subscription Management*.
... Enter the *Red Hat Subscription Management Address*. The default is `subscription.rhn.redhat.com`.
... Enter the *Repository Name(s)*. The default list is {product-repo_list-511}.
... To use a HTTP proxy, select *Use HTTP Proxy* and enter your proxy details.
... Enter your Red Hat account information and click *Validate*.
... After your credentials are validated, click *Save*.
.. To register with Red Hat Satellite 6:
... In *Register to*, select *Red Hat Satellite 6*.
... Enter the *Red Hat Satellite 6 Address*. The default is `subscription.rhn.redhat.com`.
... Enter the *Repository Name(s)*. The default list is {product-repo_list-511}.
... To use a HTTP proxy, select *Use HTTP Proxy* and enter your proxy details.
... Enter your Red Hat Satellite account information and click *Validate*.
... After your credentials are validated, click *Save*.

Your appliance now appears in the *Appliance Updates* list as `Not registered`.

To register your appliance:

. Select the appliance from the *Appliance Updates* list.
. Click *Register* to subscribe the appliance and attach subscriptions.

Registering and attaching subscriptions takes a few minutes. The subscription process is complete when the appliance reports that it is `Subscribed` under *Update Status*, and `Registered` under *Last Message*.

You can now apply updates to your appliance.
