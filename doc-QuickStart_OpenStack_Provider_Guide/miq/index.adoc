=== Obtaining the {product-title} Appliance

. In a browser, navigate to link:https://www.manageiq.org/download[].
. Select *OpenStack* from the *--Choose your platform--* list.
. Select *Stable (fine-2)* from the *--Choose a release--* list.
. Follow the instructions to download the appliance.

=== Deploying the Appliance as a Virtual Machine

Upon obtaining the {product-title} appliance, deploy it in a network where it can communicate with the OpenStack management network. You can deploy the appliance on bare metal or as a virtual machine.

To deploy the appliance as a virtual machine, perform the following steps:

[[perform-smartstate-analysis]]
== Performing a SmartState Analysis

ManageIQ can analyze a cloud Instance or infrastructure host to collect metadata such as user accounts, applications, software patches, and other internal information. This feature is called SmartState Analysis. SmartState analysis can be initiated manually or automatically using Control Policies.

== Managing Instances

Cloud instance provision goes through three phases:

. Request: This includes ownership information, tags, virtual hardware requirements, the operating system, and any customization required.
. Approval: Provisioning requests are then approved or denied. This phase can happen automatically or manually.
. Provision: Approved provisioning requests are executed.

[[tenant-mapping]]
== Tenant Mapping

include::common/openstack/tenant-mapping.adoc[]

In previous releases, {product-title_short} and OpenStack tenants were disparate and unrelated entities. Tenant mapping creates a one-to-one association between tenants from both products.

=== Managing Tenants

You can manage tenants through two different sections of the {product-title_short} interface:

* To view OpenStack tenants, navigate to menu:Compute[Clouds > Tenants]
* To view the {product-title_short} tenants, navigate to menu:Compute[Administrator | EVM > Configuration]. Under the *Access Control* accordion, click *Tenants*.

The {product-title_short} view provides a heirarchy, with the top _root_ level being the base {product-title_short} tenant. Every cloud provider is a child tenant of the base {product-title_short} tenant. Each OpenStack tenant is nested under its corresponding cloud provider.
