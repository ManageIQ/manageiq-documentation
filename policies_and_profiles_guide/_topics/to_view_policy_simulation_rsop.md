# Viewing Policy Simulation - Resultant Set of Policy (RSOP)

After the Policy Profiles are assigned, you can see the
final result of the resolution of all policies based on
which Events occur. Based on the result, you can adjust
your Policies. To view RSOP, go to the control area in the
{{ site.data.product.title_short }} console.

1. Browse to menu: **Control > Simulation**.

2. From the **Event Selection** area, select a type of
   event, and then the specific event you need the result
   for.
