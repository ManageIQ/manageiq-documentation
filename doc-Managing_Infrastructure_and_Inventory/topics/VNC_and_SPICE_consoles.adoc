[[_vnc_and_spice_consoles]]
= Remote Consoles

A console is a graphical window that allows you to view the start up screen, shut down screen, and desktop of a virtual machine, and to interact with that virtual machine in a similar way to a physical machine. 

{product-title} offers the following support for HTML5-based VNC, SPICE, and WebMKS consoles:

* VNC and SPICE consoles for Red Hat Virtualization Manager with websocket proxy.
* VMware's WebMKS HTML5-based console type. 
* VNC consoles for OpenStack using OpenStack-supplied websocket proxy.

[NOTE]
====
* VMware no longer supports the MKS console type. Also, VMRC is no longer a browser plugin but a native desktop application. As a result, the VMware MKS and the VMRC plugin options have been disabled in {product-title_short}.

* Currently, attempting to connect to the VMware WebMKS console for a virtual machine fails when the server security type is set to `2` for that virtual machine.

* Due to VMware licensing restrictions, Red Hat cannot ship the WebMKS SDK in {product-title_short}. For information on how to configure WebMKS support in {product-title_short}, see <<Configuring WebMKS Support in {product-title_short}>>.
====

All of the above make use of the websocket protocol supported by all recent versions of browsers, and can use SSL to encrypt the websocket connection.

OpenStack:: {product-title} only makes an API call to get the URL for the console and open that console in a web browser; see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/single/instances-and-images-guide/#connect_to_an_instance[Directly Connect to a VNC Console] in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform _Instances and Images Guide_ for more details.

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager and VMware:: By default, the websocket connection runs over HTTPS or HTTP based on how the application was accessed.
Under an appliance, you will most likely use HTTPS, and, therefore, the websocket connection will be wss:// (websocket with SSL).

When configuring Red Hat Virtualization Manager for virtual machine console access, set the display type for each virtual machine to `noVNC` or `SPICE HTML5`.

For more information on configuring console options, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.0/single/virtual-machine-management-guide#sect-Configuring_Console_Options[Configuring Console Options] in the Red Hat Virtualization _Virtual Machine Management Guide_.

[[configuring-console-access-to-vmware-esxi-hosts-at-a-network-layer]]
== Configuring Console Access to VMware ESXi Hosts At A Network Layer

When configuring access to the VNC or HTML5 console, make sure that at a network layer:

* All VNC ports (5900-6000) are opened from the machine on which you access the {product-title} Console to the {product-title}.
* All VNC ports (5900-6000) are opened from the {product-title} to each VMware ESXi host running virtual machines that you want to access.
* The firewall on VMware ESXi hosts is enabled and that the VMware ESXi host firewall ports are opened.
* The VNC service (`gdbserver`) is running and that the `gdbserver` service has an association with ports 5900-6000 usually defined with a `/etc/vmware/firewall/service.xml` firewall rules configuration.
+
The `gdbserver` ruleset must be enabled on each ESXi host running virtual machines that will be accessed through the HTML5 console or VNC console on the {product-title}. The ruleset can be configured on the host itself, or using the VMware vCenter web user interface.

The following procedures apply to VMware vCenter 5.0 and later.

[[using-ssh-to-configure-vmware-esxi-hosts-to-enable-console-access]]
=== Using SSH to Configure VMware ESXi Hosts to Enable Console Access

Configure the `gdbserver` ruleset on the host using SSH.

. Access the host:
+
----
# ssh host@example.com
----
. Set the `gdbserver` parameter:
+
----
# esxcli network firewall ruleset set --ruleset-id gdbserver --enabled true
----
. Confirm that the ruleset is active:
+
----
# esxcli network firewall ruleset list
----

=== Using the VMware vCenter Web Interface to Configure ESXi Hosts to Enable Console Access

Configure the `gdbserver` ruleset on the host using the VMware vCenter web user interface.

. Select the ESXi host in the VMware vCenter web interface.
. Click the *Manage* tab.
. Click the *Settings* sub tab.
. Click menu:System[Security Profile] from the list on the left.
. Click *Edit*.
. Select the `gdbserver` ruleset, and then click *OK*.

=== Configuring the VMware ESXi Host Firewall Ports for Console Access

Follow these steps to configure the VMware ESXi host firewall ports for HTML5 or VNC console access to guest virtual machine consoles. The firewall ports must be enabled on each VMware ESXi host running virtual machines that will be accessed through the HTML5 or VNC console on the {product-title}.

. Log in to your vSphere Client and select menu:Home[Inventory > Hosts and Clusters].
. In the *Hosts/Clusters* tree view, select the VMware ESXi host you want to configure for HTML5 or VNC console access.
. Select the *Configuration* tab and open the *Software* box.
. Select *Security Profile*.
. Navigate to the *Firewall Properties* dialog window by selecting the *Properties* link from the *Firewall* section.
. In the *Firewall Properties*, scroll down to *GDB Server* and select it.
. Click *OK*.

== Configuring the Browser Plug-in for a Virtual Machine Console

This section only applies to using the VMware MKS or VMware VMRC browser plug-ins for accessing a virtual machine console. It does not apply to access through the HTML5 console.

To use a browser plug-in for accessing a virtual machine console, you must have installed VNC on the machine on which you access the {product-title} Console and installed either the VMware MKS plug-in or the VMware VMRC plug-in in your browser.

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*.
. Click on the *Settings* accordion, then click *Zones*.
. Click the zone where the {product-title_short} server is located.
. Click on the server.
. Click the *Advanced* tab.
. Under the *server* configuration parameter, add the following line:
+
----
remote_console_type: console
----
+
Replace `console` with the browser plug-in that you have set up. Valid values are `mks` and `vmrc`.
. Click *Save*.
