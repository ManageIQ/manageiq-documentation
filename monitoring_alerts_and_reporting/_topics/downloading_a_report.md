#### Downloading a Report

Download reports to analyze the data using other tools or to print the
report.

When you click on one of the supplied reports, you are presented with a
group of buttons to download the report in one of three formats or to
view the report in a full screen.

1.  Navigate to **Overview > Reports**.

2.  Click the report you want to view.

3.  Click on the row for the instance of the report you want to
    download. If the report needs to be generated, see
    [Running Reports](../monitoring_alerts_and_reporting/sect_reports#running_reports).

4.  Click on the report download buttons for the type of export you
    want.

      - Click ![textimage](../images/textimage.png) **(Download this
        report in text format)** to download as text.

      - Click ![textimage](../images/textimage.png) **(Download this
        report in csv format)** to download as a comma-separated file.

      - Click ![2134](../images/2134.png) **(Download this report in PDF
        format)** to download as PDF.

      - The report is automatically named with the type of report and
        date.

**Note:**

Edit and delete buttons are only visible to administrators and super
administrators. Edit and delete functions are only available to
customer-created reports. The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} pre-configured reports
cannot be edited or deleted, but they can be copied.
