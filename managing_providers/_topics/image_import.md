# Image Import Workflows

## IBM PowerVC to IBM Power Systems Virtual Server

The image import functionality allows you to easily move an image from your on-prem PowerVC environment to an off-prem Power Systems Virtual Server environment using {{ site.data.product.title_short }} web interface.
The enablement of the workflow in {{ site.data.product.title_short }} requires you to perform certain preparations that are described in detail below.

### Preparing {{ site.data.product.title_short }} hosting server (required once):

The following commands are to be run on a server (or in a corresponding docker container) that is dedicated to hosting your {{ site.data.product.title_short }} instance.

1. Install `ansible-runner` application using the installation [instructions](https://ansible-runner.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html). The application must be available in the the command line
of the user under which the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} web-server is running.


### Preparing IBM PowerVC Server (required once):
The  following commands are to be run on a PowerVC server that is dedicated to supporting the image import workflow.

1. Make sure that the minimal IBM PowerVC version you are using is [1.4.4](https://www.ibm.com/docs/it/powervc/1.4.4?topic=installing-power-virtualization-center).


2. Install `python3.X`, `pip3`, `virtualenv` applications as well as the `libselinux-python3` library.
   You can achieve this by issuing the following command as a "root" user:

       yum install -y python3 python-pip3 python-virtualenv libselinux-python3 gcc

   The standard `python3.X` installation will be used in order to run auxiliary scripts, which will
   upload PowerVC disk images (in Open Virtualization Format) to the [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage).
   The `pip3` is required in order to install Cloud Object Storage [Python SDK](https://github.com/ibm/ibm-cos-sdk-python) and auxiliary packages for proper functioning of the import workflow.
   The role of `virtualenv` will be to isolate python package installations that are relevant only to the image import workflow from the
   Python system packages. The `libselinux-python3` library is needed for the proper functioning of Ansible's `copy` module, which will
   be used for the copying of auxiliary data between the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} hosting site and the PowerVC server. Presence
   of `gcc` is needed as a dependency of one of the Python packages (`pycryptodome`) that will be installed on later steps.


3. Prepare enough local storage for holding transient PowerVC disk images that will be transported into Power Systems Virtual Server
   and deleted from a local storage upon workflow completion. A typical PowerVC image file size can be many GBs.
   As an example, a RHEL 8.3 disk image can be of 20GB size or more. You would therefore require more space
   in your local storage than the mentioned disk image size in order to support the import workflow.
   You would also need enough space to hold Python virtual environment described in the next steps.
   Its size however will be no more than 100MB. Additionally, import session will place auxiliary files into the sessions directory
   during the workflow execution but their collective size will not exceed 5MB. In summary, if you're attempting to import an image 
   whose size is 'G' Gigabytes, then having 'G+1' Gigabytes of free space in that directory would be sufficient.

   
4. Create an empty sessions directory `/home/sessions` which will have to be located on the local storage with sufficient space
   as described in the previous step. In addition, make sure that already existing `/var/opt/ibm/powervc/imgstaging` directory also 
   has at least G+1 Gigabytes of free storage as described in previous paragraph since IBM PowerVC internally uses it as a temporary 
   staging area during export of images to the local filesystem. 
 
       mkdir /home/sessions

5. The image import workflow will use Ansible via SSH from the {{ site.data.product.title_short }} server in order to execute commands on the PowerVC server. At this point you need to choose a system user 
   that will be made available to {{ site.data.product.title_short }} instance for connection to the PowerVC server via SSH. Make sure the user has a read/write access to the `/home/sessions` directory.
   The user must also be able to execute `powervc-image` application through the command line. In general, a good security practice would be 
   to permit user only as much as it is required to run the import workflow. We will assume that all further commands in this section are executed using this existing or newly created system user:

       su - your_user

7. Create a separate virtual Python environment:

       virtualenv --system-site-packages /home/sessions/venv

   This environment will hold Python packages that are relevant only to the image import workflow
   and as such will not be available system-wide. Conversely, the `--system-site-packages` will indicate to the application that the existing Python system packages are to be made available
   to the virtual environment.


7. Installing packages in the environment requires one to first activate the environment after which
   all the Python package installations via `pip3` will become environment relative only. Therefore, activate the newly created Python environment:

       source /home/sessions/venv/bin/activate


8. Install Python packages inside the virtual environment using: 

       pip3 install pathlib pycryptodome ibm-cos-sdk

   The `pathlib` is  used for handling file paths. The `pycryptodome` is required for
   encrypting/decrypting IBM Cloud connection credentials and the `ibm-cos-sdk` represents the IBM Cloud Object Storage Python SDK.


9. Upon completing the Python package installations above you should exit the virtual environment by running:

       deactivate

11. Make sure to have a valid PowerVC connection/resource file under `/opt/ibm/powervc/powervcrc` (or at your custom location) containing similar definitions
    (the values below represent an example and not a suggestion for usage).

        export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
        export OS_AUTH_URL=https://host:5000/v3/
        export OS_CACERT=/etc/pki/tls/certs/powervc.crt
        export OS_REGION_NAME=RegionOne
        export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=Default
        export OS_PROJECT_NAME=ibm-default
        export OS_TENANT_NAME=$OS_PROJECT_NAME
        export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=Default
        export OS_USERNAME=root
        export OS_PASSWORD=password
        export OS_COMPUTE_API_VERSION=2.46
        export OS_NETWORK_API_VERSION=2.0
        export OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION=2
        export OS_VOLUME_API_VERSION=2

12. The last step is to test the exporting of PowerVC disk image to the local filesystem. Firstly, execute:

        source /opt/ibm/powervc/powervcrc

    This will acquire all the environmental variables required for issuing commands to the corresponding PowerVC instance. Now run the following command:

        powervc-image list

     The output should be similar to the one below:

        +----------+--------------------------------------+--------+---------+------+-------------+--------------+-----------+------------+
        | Name     | ID                                   | Status | Volumes | Size | Description | Architecture | OS Distro | Exportable |
        +----------+--------------------------------------+--------+---------+------+-------------+--------------+-----------+------------+
        | test-IMG | XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX | active | 1       | 20   |             | ppc64        | rhel      | True       |
        +----------+--------------------------------------+--------+---------+------+-------------+--------------+-----------+------------+

      Note the name of the image you would like to export, which will be `test-IMG` in our example. Next export the image of your choice:

        powervc-image export -i test-IMG -p /home/sessions/image.ova

      It is a time-consuming operation with the runtime taking several minutes to complete depending on the size of exported image.
      Once the operation completes you should be able to find the exported image under `/home/sessions/image.ova`.  At this stage you can remove the exported image thus concluding the test:

        rm /home/sessions/image.ova

### Add a Cloud Object Storage provider in {{ site.data.product.title_short }}: 

1. See the corresponding instructions [here](storage_providers/ibm_cloud_object_storage_managers.html).

2. Create a bucket in your Cloud Object Storage that will hold the transient OVA image files.    
   ![New Bucket](../images/new_bucket.png) 
 
   Make sure to choose the region for the bucket that **corresponds** to the region that you have specified when registering the
   Cloud Object Storage provider.

   **NOTE**: The "root" user as well as the workflow dedicated user of the PowerVC server from step [5](#preparing-ibm-powervc-server-required-once) 
   would both be able to decrypt the Cloud Object Storage's credentials during the execution of the import workflow and therefore make sure to take 
   this into consideration in your security setup.

### Add an IBM Power Systems Virtual Server provider in {{ site.data.product.title_short }}:

1. See the corresponding instructions [here](cloud_providers/ibm_power_systems_virtual_servers_providers.html).

### Add an IBM PowerVC provider in {{ site.data.product.title_short }}:

1. See the corresponding instructions [here](cloud_providers/ibm_power_vc_providers.html).

2. Specify the image import related parameters on the PowerVC registration form.   

* Enter the SSH username for access to the PowerVC server. It corresponds to the user on your PowerVC server that is dedicated to
running image import related commands via Ansible as described in [5](#preparing-ibm-powervc-server-required-once).

* Enter the private key and the private key passphrase (if present).

### Grant Image Import Permissions in {{ site.data.product.title_short }}:

User performing image import needs a corresponding permission in {{ site.data.product.title_short }} in order
to perform this operation. For granting permissions, log-in through an administrative account and navigate 
to `Settings -> Application Settings -> Access Control`. Make sure the user of your choice has permissions for 
`Import Cloud Template` action through the user's corresponding group and role.

### Enable Embedded Ansible in {{ site.data.product.title_short }}:

Currently the workflow event is queued as Embedded Ansible playbook upon request submission and as such the corresponding functionality has to be enabled
in {{ site.data.product.title_short }} by navigating to: `Settings -> Application Settings -> Settings`

![Enable Embedded Ansible](../images/import_emb_ansible.png)


### Start the workflow
The workflow operates by exporting the image as an OVA file onto a PowerVC local storage, uploading it to the Cloud Object Storage bucket and then transferring it into Power Systems Virtual Server image registry. In order to initiate the workflow:

1. Queue the refreshing of all the above mentioned (cloud and storage) providers and wait for the operations to complete.
![Import Image Button Screenshot](../images/refresh_providers.png)


2. Navigate to the Power Systems Virtual Server provider added above.    
![Import Image Button Screenshot](../images/import_button.png)


3. Click on the `Import Image` button after which an import form will appear.


4. Choose the PowerVC provider added above as a source provider.


5. Choose the image you would like to import.


6. Choose the Cloud Object Storage provider added above.


7. Choose the transient bucket created above.


8. Choose target disk type for the image being imported.


9. Choose the timeout value for your request (default is 3 hours).


10. Check the corresponding box if you wish to keep the OVA file in the cloud bucket upon workflow completion.


11. Click on the `Import` button initiating the workflow.  
  ![Import Image Button Screenshot](../images/pvc_pvs_import_form.png)


12. The workflow can take an hour or more depending on the image size, bucket location,
Power Systems Virtual Server and PowerVC internal load.


13. Watch for the current status of the workflow under `Settings -> Tasks -> All Tasks`.  
  ![Workflow Form Screenshot](../images/miq_import_task.png)


14. Initiate the refreshing of the Power Systems Virtual Server provider upon workflow completion and
wait for the newly imported image to appear.


### Troubleshooting

* If the {{site.data.product.title_short}} UI shows no detailed error description then make sure to check the latest logs with `journalctl -t evm` or `oc logs` on a server or pod that hosts your {{site.data.product.title_short}} instance.

* If  `{{ site.data.product.title_short }}` server is terminated during the workflow execution then certain residual objects will 
  have to be removed manually. These are potentially the session directory on the PowerVC server under `/home/sessions`, the already uploaded OVA 
  image file in the Cloud Object Storage bucket or its parts as explained [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-large-objects) (see `Abort incomplete multipart uploads`).

* Currently only one import workflow for a given PowerVC <--> Power Systems Virtual Server pair is allowed. Any newly submitted import workflow, where at least one of the instances in the pair is involved with some other
  import workflow request, will be queued until the latter completes. You would need to cancel such already executing workflow in order to force immediate execution of the newly submitted one.
