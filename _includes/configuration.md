## Configuring {{ site.data.product.title_short }}

After installing {{ site.data.product.title_short }} and running it for the first
time, you must perform some basic configuration. You must complete these steps:

1.  Add a disk to the infrastructure that is hosting your appliance.

2.  Configure the database.

3.  Configure messaging

Configure the appliance by using the internal appliance console.

### Accessing the Appliance Console

1.  Start the appliance and open a terminal console.

2.  Enter the `appliance_console` command. The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance
    summary screen displays.

3.  Press `Enter` to manually configure settings.

4.  Press the number for the item you want to change, and press `Enter`.
    The options for your selection are displayed.

5.  Follow the prompts to make the changes.

6.  Press `Enter` to accept a setting where applicable.

**Note:**

The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance console automatically logs out
after five minutes of inactivity.

### Configuring a Database

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} uses a database to store information about the
environment. Before using {{ site.data.product.title_short }}, configure the database
options for it; {{ site.data.product.title_short }} provides the following two
options for database configuration:

  - Configure the appliance to use an external PostgreSQL database

#### Configuring an External Database

Based on your setup, you will choose to configure the appliance to use
an external PostgreSQL database. For example, we can only have one
database in a single region. However, a region can be segmented into
multiple zones, such as database zone, user interface zone, and
reporting zone, where each zone provides a specific function. The
appliances in these zones must be configured to use an external
database.

The `postgresql.conf` file used with {{ site.data.product.title_short }} databases requires
specific settings for correct operation. For example, it must correctly
reclaim table space, control session timeouts, and format the PostgreSQL
server log for improved system support. It is recommended that external databases use a
`postgresql.conf` file based on the standard file used by the
{{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance.

Ensure you configure the settings in the `postgresql.conf` to suit your
system. For example, customize the `shared_buffers` setting according to
the amount of real storage available in the external system hosting the
PostgreSQL instance. In addition, depending on the aggregate number of
appliances expected to connect to the PostgreSQL instance, it may be
necessary to alter the `max_connections` setting.

**Note:**

  - {{ site.data.product.title_short }} requires PostgreSQL version 10.

  - Because the `postgresql.conf` file controls the operation of all
    databases managed by a single instance of PostgreSQL, do not mix
    {{ site.data.product.title_short }} databases with other types of databases in a single
    PostgreSQL instance.

1.  Start the appliance and open a terminal console.

2.  Enter the `appliance_console` command. The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance
    summary screen displays.

3.  Press **Enter** to manually configure settings.

4.  Select **Configure Application** from the menu.

5.  Choose **Create Region in External Database** for the database location.

6.  Enter the database hostname or IP address when prompted.

7.  Enter the database name or leave blank for the default
    (`vmdb_production`).

8.  Enter the database username or leave blank for the default (`root`).

9. Enter the chosen database user’s password.

10. Confirm the configuration if prompted.

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} will then configure the external database.

### Configure Messaging

Configuring messaging is required for appliance setup. It is recommended to configure the broker on the same appliance where your database is configured

1. You can either configure the current appliance as a kafka broker, or point the
   appliance to an existing external kafka broker.

   Select the appropriate option either
   **Configure this appliance as a messaging server** or
   **Connect to an external messaging system**
   to connect to an external kafka broker.  You will be asked to fill in the
   required **Message Client Parameters** like IP address and username/password.

2. Select **Proceed** and appliance_console will apply the configuration that you have
   requested then restart evmserverd to pick up the changes.

### Configuring a Worker Appliance

You can use multiple appliances to facilitate horizontal scaling, as
well as for dividing up work by roles. Accordingly, configure an
appliance to handle work for one or many roles, with workers within the
appliance carrying out the duties for which they are configured. You can
configure a worker appliance through the terminal. The following steps
demonstrate how to join a worker appliance to an appliance that already
has a region configured with a database and messaging.

1.  Start the appliance and open a terminal console.

2.  Enter the `appliance_console` command. The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance
    summary screen displays.

3.  Press **Enter** to manually configure settings.

4.  Select **Configure Application** from the menu.

5.  You are prompted to create or fetch a security key. Since this is
    not the first {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance, choose **2) Fetch key from
    remote machine**. For worker and multi-region setups, use this
    option to copy the security key from another appliance.

    **Note:**

    All {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliances in a multi-region deployment
    must use the same key.

6.  Choose **Join Region in External Database** for the database location.

7.  Enter the database hostname or IP address when prompted.

8.  Enter the port number or leave blank for the default (`5432`).

9.  Enter the database name or leave blank for the default
    (`vmdb_production`).

10. Enter the database username or leave blank for the default (`root`).

11. Enter the chosen database user’s password.

12. Confirm the configuration if prompted.

13. Choose **Connect to an external messaging system** to connect to the external kafka broker located on the appliance with the external database

14. Enter the necessary **Message Client Parameters** such as the hostname/IP and username/password

14. Confirm the configuration if prompted.
