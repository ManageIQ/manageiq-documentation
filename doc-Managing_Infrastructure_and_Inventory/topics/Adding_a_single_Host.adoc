= Adding a Single Host

To analyze a host for more detailed information, add it to the VMDB first.
If the host has not been found during #Host Discovery# or #Provider Refresh#, and the host's IP address is known, use the btn:[Add a New Host] button.

. Navigate to menu:Infrastructure[Hosts].
. Click  image:images/1847.png[] btn:[(Configuration)], then click  image:images/1848.png[] btn:[(Add a new Host)].
. Type the #Name#, #Host Name#, and #IP Address# of the host to add. #Name# is how the device is labeled in the console.
  Select the type of operating system from the #Host Platform# dropdown.
  If the Host has been found during #Discovery# or #Refresh# and the host's operating system has been identified, the #Host Platform# selector remains disabled.
  If adding an IPMI server for provisioning, add in the IP address of that host.
+
IMPORTANT: The #Host Name# must use a unique fully qualified domain name.

. In the #Credentials# box, the #Default# tab provides fields to type a user name with elevated security credentials and the user's password.
  If using domain credentials, the format for #User ID# is in the format of [domainname]\[username]. On ESX hosts, if the SSH login is disabled for the #Default# user, type in a user with remote login access on the #Remote Login# tab.
