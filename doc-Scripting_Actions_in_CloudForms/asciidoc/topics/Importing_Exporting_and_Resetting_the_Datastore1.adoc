==== Importing, Exporting, and Resetting the Datastore

The Automate Model can be exported and imported as a YAML file.
CloudForms Management Engine allows you to back up your model by export.
Red Hat may provide you with new or updated classes, and provides an
import function for either a class or the entire model. Finally, you can
reset the datastore to its default. Always be sure to export the current
datastore before importing or resetting.
