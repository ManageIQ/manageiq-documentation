=== Running Reports

There are two different ways to generate a report: by scheduling the report, or running the report manually by clicking the report generation button on the *Reports* page.
{product-title} uses interactive report generation so that reports are placed on a queue.
A visual indicator of the reports status is shown.
All reports are automatically saved so that they can be downloaded and analyzed later.
