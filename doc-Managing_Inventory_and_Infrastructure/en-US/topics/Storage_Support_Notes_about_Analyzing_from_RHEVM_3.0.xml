	<title>SmartState Analysis on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0 - Storage Support Notes</title>
	<para>
		There are two additional steps required to perform a SmartState Analysis on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0 using iSCSI or FCP storage. NFS storage does not have these requirements.
	</para>
	<procedure>
		<step>
			<para>
				Enable DirectLUN support for the host and CloudForms Management Engine Appliance that performs the analysis.
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Enable DirectLUN on host.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Enable DirectLUN on the CloudForms Management Engine Appliance. To do this, edit the desired Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization storage and get the LUNID value. Then, on the CloudForms Management Engine Appliance virtual machine in the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization user interface, right-click and select <menuchoice><guilabel>Edit</guilabel> <guilabel>Custom Properties</guilabel></menuchoice> and enter the following in the <guilabel>Custom Properties</guilabel> edit box: 
						<screen>directlun=&lt;LUN ID&gt;:readonly</screen> If you have multiple storage domains separate them by a comma, similar to: 
						<screen>directlun=&lt;LUN ID 1&gt;:readonly,&lt;LUN ID 2&gt;:readonly,&lt;LUN ID N&gt;:readonly</screen>
					</para>
					<note>
						<para>
							The CloudForms Management Engine Appliance must reside in the same data center as the storage you are trying to connect. If you have multiple data centers with iSCSI or FCP storage, you need a CloudForms Management Engine Appliance in each data center to support virtual machine scanning.
						</para>
					</note>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</step>
		<step>
			<para>
				Set Server Relationship - This is required to allow the virtual machine SmartState analysis job to determine which data center a CloudForms Management Engine Appliance is running and therefore identify what storage it has access to in a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.
			</para>
			<substeps>
				<step>
					<para>
						After setting up a CloudForms Management Engine Appliance and performing a refresh of the Provider, find the CloudForms Management Engine Appliance in the <guilabel>Virtual Machine</guilabel> accordion list and view its summary screen.
					</para>

					<para>
						Select the server that relates to this instance of the CloudForms Management Engine Appliance.
