==== Retiring Virtual Machines and Instances

When a virtual machine or instance is no longer required, it can be retired. Once a virtual machine or instance reaches its retirement date, it is immediately shut down and not allowed to restart. If an attempt to restart is made, {product-title} will shut down the virtual machine or instance.

There are three built-in policies involved with retirement:

* If the virtual machine or instance reaches its retirement date, it will be stopped even if it is running.
* If a retired virtual machine or instance is requested to start through {product-title}, the virtual machine or instance will not be allowed to start.
* If a provider starts a retired virtual machine or instance outside of {product-title}, the virtual machine or instance will be stopped.

{product-title} provides a number of ways to retire a virtual machine or instance:

* By using the allocated buttons in the {product-title} console.
* When creating a provision request, a retirement date can be set up.

=== Setting Retirement in a Provision Request

If you are using {product-title} to provision, you can set when you want retirement in the provision request. To see how to create a request, go to *Provisioning Requests*. A warning email will be sent to the owner before the retirement.

[[scheduling-retirement-in-a-provision-request]]
==== Scheduling Retirement in a Provision Request

After provisioning either a Cloud Instance or Virtual Machine, a multi-tabbed screen appears where you can set up your provision requests. The *Schedule* tab allows you to choose to power on the virtual machines or instances after they are created, and to set a retirement date. If you select a retirement period, you will be prompted for when you want a retirement warning.
