= Viewing Capacity and Utilization Charts for a Datastore

You can view capacity and utilization data for a datastore. 

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} requires network visibility to your provider assigned the server role of #Capacity & Utilization Collector# to enable this feature. 
====

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Datastores], then click the Datastore for which to view Capacity and Utilization data. 
. Click  image:1994.png[Monitoring] (*Monitoring*), and then image:1994.png[Utilization] (*Utilization*).
. From *Interval*, select to view hourly or daily data points and the dates to view data.
. Use *VM Types to Include* to include only managed/registered, managed/unregistered, or unmanaged virtual machines.

* *Managed/Registered VM* - A virtual machine connected to a host and exists in the VMDB. Also, a template connected to a management system and exists in the VMDB. 
+
[NOTE]
====
Templates cannot be connected to a host. 
====
+
* *Managed/Unregistered VM* - A virtual machine or template that resides on a repository or is no longer connected to a management system or host and exists in the VMDB. A virtual machine previously considered registered might become unregistered if the virtual machine is removed from management system inventory. 
* *Not Managed* - Files discovered on a datastore that do not have a virtual machine associated with them in the VMDB. These files might be registered to a management system that {product-title} does not have configuration information. Possible causes might be the management system has not been discovered or the management system has been discovered but no security credentials are provided. 

. Use *Time Profiles* to select a time range for the data. 

[NOTE] 
====
Daily charts only include full days of data.
If a day does not include all the 24 data points for a day, the data does not show for that day.
