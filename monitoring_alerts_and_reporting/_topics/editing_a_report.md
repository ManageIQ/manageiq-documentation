### Editing a Report

If you find that a report is not giving you the data that you need, you
can edit it after it has been created. Note that only reports that you
have created can be modified. Only administrators and super
administrators of {{ site.data.product.title_short }} can add, copy, edit, and delete
reports.

1.  Navigate to **Overview > Reports**.

    report you want to edit.

    ![1851](../images/1851.png) (**Edit this Report**).
