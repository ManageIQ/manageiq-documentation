= Suspending Providers

{product-title} allows temporary suspension of providers and related workers to support running maintenance, such as network maintenance leading to connectivity issues to a provider. Suspending a provider and its workers during maintenance can alleviate the impact on storage and performance caused by logged error message. Once suspended, data collection on a provider ceases. Upon completion of maintenance, provider operation can be resumed via {product-title_short}.

Suspend and resume operations apply to:

. Cloud Providers
. Infrastructure Providers
. Physical Infrastructure Providers
