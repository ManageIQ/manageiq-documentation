# Searching for Virtual Machines or Templates

To the right of the taskbar on the *Virtual Machines* page, you can enter names or parts
of names for searching. You can search in the following ways:

- Type characters that are included in the name. For example, if you type `sp1`, all Virtual Machines whose names include `sp1` appear, such as `Windows2003sp1` and `Sp1clone`.

- Use `*` at the end of a term to search for names that begin with specific characters. For example, type `v*` to find all virtual machines whose names begin with the letter `v`.

- Use `\*` at the beginning of a term to search for names that end with specific characters. For example, type `*sp2` to find all virtual machines whose names end with `sp2`.

- Erase all characters from the search box to go back to viewing all virtual machines.
