## Overview Dashboard

Overview shows your virtual environment’s events, reports, and
configurable alerts. This information supports better information
technology decision making and predictions for future virtual machine
management.

When you log in to the console, it brings you directly to the **Overview
Dashboard** page by default. The console uses widgets to organize this
page, providing you with a default set of commonly used widgets. The
configuration items on these widgets are clickable, allowing you to
drill down directly to a referenced item.

Customize this page to include charts and reports you specifically want
to see as soon as you log in to the console. You can add, remove, move,
minimize, zoom into, and maximize widgets. Only users with the proper
access can create widgets.
