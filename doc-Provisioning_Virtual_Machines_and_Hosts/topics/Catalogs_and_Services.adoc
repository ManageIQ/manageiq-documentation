[[catalogs-services]]
== Catalogs and Services

Through the use of catalogs, {product-title} provides support for multi-tier service provisioning to deploy layered workloads across hybrid environments. You can create customized dialogs that will give consumers of the services the ability to input just a few parameters and provision the entire service. The following table lists the terminology associated with catalogs that you will use within the CloudForms user interface for service provisioning.

.Terminology
[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header",]
|====
|Type|Information
|Catalog Bundle|A group of templates.
|Catalog Item|A single template.
|Template|A template is a copy of a preconfigured virtual machine, designed to capture the installed software and software configurations, as well as the hardware configuration of the original virtual machine.
|Dialog Tabs|Part of a service dialog.
|Element|An item on a tab in a dialog. It can be a button, check box, drop down list, radio button, tag control, text area box, or a text box.
|Provisioning Dialogs|Dialogs created for host provisioning, virtual machine migration, or virtual machine provisioning. The dialog name must be added to the appropriate provision instance to be processed.
|Service Catalog|A catalog item or catalog bundle that is available for provisioning.
|Service Dialogs|Made up of fully customizable tabs, items, and values for use with service provisioning.

[[dynamic-resource-objects]]
==== Dynamic Resource Objects

Dynamic resource objects are object-like entities, defined at runtime, that have unique names and user-defined attributes and relationships. Residing in the Automate Engine datastore, dynamic resource objects are designed to manage objects other than those related to private infrastructure, and public or private cloud providers. 

Using automate requests, services and catalog items, dynamic resource objects can be directly accessed or passed, during any step, as a parameter to a service state machine. As a result, dynamic resource objects can be used to quickly add the capability to provision and collect data on resources not supported by {product-title}.

[[view-dynamic-resource-objects]]
===== View Dynamic Resource Objects Classes

View a list of dynamic resource objects and click through to see detailed summary information for each object. 

. Navigate to menu:Automate[Dynamic Resource Objects].
. Click on a dynamic resource object class in the table to view its summary information.

[[service-dialogs]]
==== Service Dialogs

When provisioning a service, input will be needed from the requester. Service dialogs are used to take input from the user. This input is connected to a method in the Automate model that defines how the users input is translated into the provision request. Before creating a service dialog, be sure to plan what items you need the user to input.

[[adding-a-service-dialog-using-editor]]
===== Adding a Service Dialog
[IMPORTANT]
====
When creating a service dialog for use with Ansible playbook catalog items, variable elements must use the prefix *param_* when assigning the value. For example, a new variable labeled *key1* should have its value set as *param_key1*.

[[methods]]
==== Methods

[[creating-a-method-to-associate-with-the-dialog]]
===== Creating a Method to Associate with the Dialog

You will need to create a method that connects the values in the dialog with the provisioning request. The method should be created in the `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template` class of the *Automate* model.

[NOTE]
====
*DOMAIN* must be a user-defined Domain and not the locked ManageIQ Domain. If necessary, you can copy the class from the ManageIQ domain into a custom domain.
====

A method is provided below that was created for the following scenario:

* You want to provision a three-tiered service that contains catalog items of web, app and DB. Each of these virtual machines (or cloud instances) has been tagged under the *Service* category with the appropriate value. Then, added as a catalog item and combined into a catalog bundle.
* The *Service Dialog* captures the selection of small, medium or large application in a dropdown called *service_type*. When referring to a value captured in an element in a dialog, the name of the element should be prefixed with *dialog_*. For example, *service_type* becomes *dialog_service_type* when used in the method.
* The method will set the memory sizes for each of the catalog items based on the *service_type* selection.

[[catalogs]]
=== Catalogs

Catalogs are used to create groups of virtual machines or instances for provisioning. For example, a complete package of a database server, desktop with specialized software already on it, and a firewall. You will need to complete the following steps to create and provision a service catalog.

. Create *Catalog Items* for each virtual machine or instance that will be part of the service.
. Create a *Service* dialog. For example, create a dropdown with three options small, medium, and large.
. Create a method for the Service Dialog. This method defines what each of the options means to each of the individual virtual machines or cloud instances for the service. This method is called from a service provisioning instance in the Automate model.
. Create an instance in the `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template` class that calls the method.
+
[NOTE]
====
DOMAIN must be a user-defined Domain and not the locked ManageIQ Domain. If necessary, you can copy the class from the ManageIQ domain into a custom domain.
====
+
. Associate method with Automate instance.
. Create a *Catalog Bundle*, adding each of the catalog items to it. Select the *Service Dialog* you created. Use the instance created in the `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template` class as the *Entry Point*. Check *Display in Catalog* box.
. Provision a service.


[[creating-a-catalog-bundle]]
==== Creating a Catalog Bundle

[NOTE]
====
You should also create and specify an Entry Point in the `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/Methods/CatalogBundle` class for each catalog item that is part of a bundle. If you do not, then the pre and post provision processing will occur for each item in the bundle in addition to processing for the *Catalog Bundle*. To set the entry point, go into each *Catalog Item* and check *Display in Catalog*. Then, you will see the *Entry Point* field.

[[orchestration-stack]]
=== Orchestration Stacks

Cloud orchestration is a service that allows you to create, update, and manage cloud resources and their software components as a single unit and then deploy them in an automated, repeatable way through a template.
Templates use a human-readable syntax and can be defined in text files, thereby allowing users to check them into version control. Templates allow you to easily deploy and reconfigure infrastructure for applications within your cloud. A user can author the stack templates, or can upload them from other sources.

{product-title} supports adding Amazon CloudFormation, OpenStack Heat, Microsoft Azure, VNF, and VMware vApp template type, and provides the ability to:

* Inventory stacks and elements of each type into the {product-title_short} VMDB.
* Model the relationships of instances to their stacks, inclusive of the user interface. For example, selecting an instance within a region that is within a stack, the user interface shows this on the standard instance view.
* Model the stack and its elements in the user interface.


[NOTE]
====
When importing a template into {product-title_short}, the selected elements are converted according to their type. For example, lists convert to list boxes, and single items convert to text boxes.
