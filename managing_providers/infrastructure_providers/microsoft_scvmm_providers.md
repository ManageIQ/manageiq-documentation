# Microsoft SCVMM Providers

To use a Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM)
provider, add it to the appliance and set up the SCVMM server for
authentication.

**Note:**

To use a SCVMM provider, you must have at least one network adapter available for communication between the host and the SCVMM management server. Make sure that **Used by Management** is checked for this network adapter in the SCVMM host properties.
