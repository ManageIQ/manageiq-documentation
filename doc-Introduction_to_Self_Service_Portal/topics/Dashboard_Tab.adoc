Monthly Charges - This Month To Date::

The Self Service user interface has added basic support for displaying monthly chargeback data of the computing and storage cost for the use of resources, in the currencies supported by the full administrative user interface. This provides a quick summary of where you are from cost standpoint to that point in the month. For more information about configuring chargeback rates in the full administrative user interface and how {product-title} calculates chargeback costs, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.5/single/monitoring-alerts-and-reporting/#sect_chargeback[Chargeback] in the _Monitoring, Alerts, and Reporting_ guide.  

[NOTE]
====
If you are on the first day of the month, there can be no data yet therefore resulting in zero dollar amount. Also, if you have a lot of data, it might not have rolled into the new month yet, resulting in no data and dollar amount for month to date.
