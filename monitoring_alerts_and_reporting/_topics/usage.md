## Usage

Usage provides a targeted view of CPU, RAM, disk space, disk I/O, and
network I/O for tagged virtual machines. This allows you to find which
virtual machines are using or overusing resources.

There are two requirements to use this feature:

  - You must assign tags to the virtual machines that you want to
    collect usage data for.

  - Capacity and utilization collection must be enabled.
