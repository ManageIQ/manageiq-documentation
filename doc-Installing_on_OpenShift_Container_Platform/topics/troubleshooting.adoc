== Troubleshooting Deployment

Under normal circumstances, the deployment process takes approximately 10 minutes. If the deployment is unsuccessful, examining deployment events and pod logs can help identify any issues.

. As a basic user, first retry the failed deployment:
+
------
$ oc get pods
NAME                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cloudforms-1-deploy  0/1       Error     0          25m
memcached-1-yasfq    1/1       Running   0          24m
postgresql-1-wfv59   1/1       Running   0          24m
------
+
------
$ oc deploy cloudforms --retry
Retried #1
Use 'oc logs -f dc/cloudforms' to track its progress.
------
+
. Allow a few seconds for the failed pod to get re-scheduled, then check events and logs:
+
------
$ oc describe pods <pod-name>
...
Events:
  FirstSeen	LastSeen	Count	From							SubobjectPath			Type		Reason		Message
  ---------	--------	-----	----							-------------			--------	------		-------
15m		15m		1	{kubelet ocp-eval-node-2.e2e.example.com}	spec.containers{cloudforms}	Warning		Unhealthy	Readiness probe failed: Get http://10.1.1.5:80/: dial tcp 10.1.1.5:80: getsockopt: connection refused
------
+
Liveness and readiness probe failures, like in the output above, indicate the pod is taking longer than expected to come online. In this case, check the pod logs.
+
. As the `cfme-app` container is `systemd` based, use `oc rsh` instead of `oc logs` to obtain journal dumps:
+
------
$ oc rsh <pod-name> journalctl -x
------
+
. Transferring all logs from the `cfme-app` pod to a directory on the host for further examination can be useful for troubleshooting. Transfer the logs with the `oc rsync` command:
+
------
$ oc rsync <pod-name>:/persistent/container-deploy/log \ 
/tmp/fail-logs/
receiving incremental file list
log/
log/appliance_initialize_1477272109.log
log/restore_pv_data_1477272010.log
log/sync_pv_data_1477272010.log

[[uninstalling]]
=== Uninstalling {product-title} from a Project

If no longer needed, you can uninstall the {product-title} pod from your project. Note the following commands do not remove SCC permissions, or the project itself.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use this procedure if only {product-title} exists in the project.
====

. Inside the project, run the following as a basic user:
+
------
$ oc delete all --all
------
+
. Wait approximately 30 seconds for the command to process, then run:
+
------
$ oc delete pvc --all
------
