== SmartProxies

The embedded SmartProxy can analyze virtual machines that are registered to a host and templates that are associated with a provider.


=== Installing the SmartProxy from the Console

The server comes with one SmartProxy version already available. It can also be installed on an ESX Server version 3.0.2, 3.5 or 4.

[IMPORTANT]
======
Contact Red Hat before installing a new SmartProxy on an ESX Server.
======

Requirements:

* On ESX, SSH (Secure Shell) must be enabled. This is usually port 22.
* 300 MB free disk space to install and run the SmartProxy.
* Administrator or root credentials.
* The host must already be in the VMDB either by discovery or manually. See the _Managing Infrastructure and Inventory_ guide, available from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/, for information on discovery.


=== Entering Credentials and Operating System for the Target Host

Set the credentials and operating system for the target host to prepare for the installation of SmartProxy.

To Enter Credentials and Operating System for the Target Host:

. Navigate to menu:Infrastructure[Hosts].
. Select the host you want to edit.
. Click image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), then image:1851.png[] (*Edit this item*).
. In the Credentials box, click the Default tab and enter your login credentials.
If you are using domain credentials, the format for User ID must be in the format of <domainname>\<username>.
For ESX hosts, if SSH login is disabled for the default user, click the Remote Login tab and enter a user with remote login access.

[IMPORTANT]
======
If the target is a Windows host, disconnect all network connections between the Windows proxy and the target.
If an existing connection uses a different set of credentials than those set in the console, the installation may fail.
======
. Click *Validate* to verify the credentials.
. If you added the host manually instead of *Host Discovery* or *Provider Refresh* finding it, select the host's operating system from the *Host Platform* drop-down box to ensure the host platform is available.
. Click *Save*.

When remotely installing on Windows hosts, the SmartProxy file is first copied to a Windows proxy. That computer then installs the file to the target host. The Windows proxy is the same as when you select the Default Repository SmartProxy box located by navigating to menu:Configure[Configuration], then clicking on the desired server, then the *Server* tab, and exploring the *Server Control* area.
