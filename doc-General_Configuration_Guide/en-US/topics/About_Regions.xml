	<title>Region Scope</title>
	<para>
		Regions are used to consolidate data from multiple VMDBs to a central database. The database at the top level, the master VMDB, cannot be used for operational tasks such as SmartState Analysis or Capacity and Utilization data collection. It is intended for use as a reporting database that includes all information across multiple subordinate regions. The subordinate regions replicate their information to the master.
	</para>
	<para>
		Note that the subordinate regions are not aware of each other from a database perspective. You cannot see information from one subordinate region in another. The only VMDB with data visibility to all subordinate regions is the top level.
