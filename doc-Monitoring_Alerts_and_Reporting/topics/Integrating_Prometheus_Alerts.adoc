== OpenShift Prometheus Alerts

[NOTE]
====
This feature is currently available as a technology preview only. For more information on the support scope for features marked as technology preview, see https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].
====

Prometheus is used as an external alerting component. {product-title_short} integrates Prometheus alerts for use with OpenShift Container Platform. {product-title_short} collects events from Prometheus, generates alerts based on these events, and then attaches alerts to inventory objects.

It is possible to view ongoing alerts in {product-title_short} by navigating to menu:Monitor[Alerts] and manage their life cycle, including the ability to:

* View active alerts per provider in the *Overview* screen.
* View alert data and related objects.
* Comment, assign, and acknowledge alerts in the *All Alerts* screen.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Network utilization metrics for OpenShift Container Platform are only collected for `eth0` network interfaces. Therefore, network utilization trend will not be displayed for network interfaces other than `eth0` on the overview screen of the provider.

=== Configuring Prometheus Alerts in {product-title_short}

Configuring and enabling Prometheus alerts in {product-title_short} comprises the following steps:

. Deploying and configuring Prometheus on OpenShift.
. Assigning Prometheus alert profiles to the enterprise in {product-title_short}.
. Adding an OpenShift Containers Provider with a Prometheus alert endpoint in {product-title_short}.

==== Deploying and Configuring Prometheus on OpenShift

. Deploy Prometheus on OpenShift by following the steps covered in link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/install_config/cluster_metrics.html#openshift-prometheus[Prometheus on OpenShift Container Platform].
. Add Prometheus to an OpenShift cluster and configure alert definitions. See the example code block below for configuring alerts (currently must be done on the Prometheus side):

----
$ oc edit configmap -n openshift-metrics prometheus
# Supported labels:
# severity: ERROR|WARNING|INFO. defaults to ERROR.
# Supported annotations:
# description: The error message displayed on the screen
# miqTarget: ContainerNode|ExtManagementSystem, defaults to ContainerNode.
# miqIgnore: "true|false", should ManageIQ pick up this alert, defaults to true.
  prometheus.rules: |
    groups:
    - name: example-rules
      interval: 30s # defaults to global interval
      rules:
      - alert: "NodeDown" << Alert starts here
        expr: up{job="kubernetes-nodes"} == 0
        annotations:
          miqTarget: "ContainerNode"
          severity: "ERROR"
          url: "https://www.example.com/node_down_fixing_instructions"
          description: "Node {{$labels.instance}} is down"
      - alert: "TooManyRequests"
        expr: rate(authenticated_user_requests[2m]) > 12
        annotations:
          miqTarget: "ExtManagementSystem"
          severity: "ERROR"
          url: "https://www.example.com/too_many_requests_fixing_instructions"
          description: "Too many authenticated requests"

. Reload the Prometheus configuration. You can do this by deleting the Prometheus pod, then redeploying with the new configuration.

==== Assigning Prometheus Alert Profiles to the Enterprise

Complete the following procedure to assign Prometheus alert profiles to the enterprise using the {product-title_short} user interface.

[NOTE]
====
Both Node and Provider alert profiles are created automatically during the installation, so it is not required to create these profiles.
====

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer], then click *Alert Profiles* in the accordion menu.
. Click to expand *Node Alert Profiles*, then click *Prometheus Node Profile*. 
. Click image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then click image:1851.png[] (*Edit assignments for this Alert Profile*). Assign the profile to *The Enterprise* from the *Assign To* list.
. Click *Save*.
. Click to expand *Provider Alert Profiles*, then click *Prometheus Provider Profile*. 
. Click *Configuration*, then click *Edit assignments for this Alert Profile*. Assign the profile to *The Enterprise* from the *Assign To* list.
. Click *Save*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Alerts triggered before assigning the profiles to the enterprise will not appear in {product-title_short} at all.

==== Adding an OpenShift Containers Provider with a Prometheus Alert Endpoint

Complete the following procedure to add an OpenShift Containers Provider with a Prometheus Alert Endpoint using the {product-title_short} user interface.

include::common/provider-ocp-add-container.adoc[] 

Once you have completed the procedure, you will have OpenShift Prometheus alerts enabled in {product-title_short}, and can manage their life cyle from the menu:Monitor[Alerts] screen in the user interface.
