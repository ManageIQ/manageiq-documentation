== Assigning the Policy Profile to a Virtual Machine

Assign the policy profile to a virtual machine and initiate SmartState analysis. Note that policy profiles can be specified at multiple levels. That is, if you assign this to a provider (Amazon EC2 or OpenStack for example), the policy profile will apply to all hosts or virtual machines for that provider.

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Clouds > Instances] or menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Virtual Machines], and select an available virtual machine.
. Click image:../images/1941.png[image] (*Policy*), then image:../images/1851.png[image] (*Manage Policies*).
. Under *Select Policy Profiles*, select the policy profile. It will turn blue to show the selection. Click the triangle next to the policy profile to see its member policies. 
. Click *Save*.
. Select the virtual machine from the available virtual machines list; click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), then image:../images/smartstate-icon.png[image] (*Perform SmartState Analysis*). A pop-up window appears to confirm the action.
. Click *OK*. SmartState analysis is initiated for the selected virtual machine or instance from the {product-title} database.

SmartState analysis will now report back findings specified by the custom virtual machine analysis profile.
