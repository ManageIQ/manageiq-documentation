=== Creating an Ansible Playbook Button

{product-title} includes an option to create an Ansible Playbook custom button. This feature allows users to select a playbook to run as well as an inventory target to run it against. An Ansible playbook type button can be defined for any object type available.
[NOTE]
====
An Ansible Playbook catalog item must exist in order to create an Ansible Playbook custom button.
