=== Fulfilling a Request

After a request has been approved, {product-title} then goes through the steps required to complete the request. The steps followed for a regular provision from a virtual machine to a virtual machine (not to a template) are found by navigating to menu:Automate[Explorer], then listed under menu:DOMAIN[Cloud|Infrastructure > VM > Provisioning > VMProvision_VM > Provision VM from Template (template)]. The value for each state shows where the instance resides in the *Datastore* accordion. The default set of execution steps is shown below. For more information on state machines, see xref:state-machines[].

[[quotas]]
==== Quotas

Quotas allow you to establish maximum usage thresholds for an user,
group, or tenant for provisioned virtual machines or instances and are
integrated into provisioning profiles. These maximums are checked
after the approval but before the actual provision request is started.
The quota is set for the tenant or group as a whole.

[[Applying-user-or-group-quota]]
===== Applying User or Group Quotas

. Log in as a user with administrator or super administrator rights to the {product-title} console.
. Navigate to menu:Automate[Explorer].
. Copy the menu:ManageIQ[System > CommonMethods > QuotaStateMachine > quota] instance to a custom DOMAIN.
. From the accordion menu, click menu:DOMAIN[System > CommonMethods > QuotaStateMachine > quota].
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, quotas are applied to tenants and do not require any change in menu:Automate[Explorer].
====

.. Set the value for *Quota Source Type* to _user_ or _group_.
.. Set the values for *VM Warning Count*, *VM Maximum Count*, *Storage Warning Limit*, *Storage Maximum Limit*, *CPU Warning Count*, *CPU Maximum Count*, *Memory Warning Limit*, or *Memory Maximum Limit* to be the maximums for a specific user or group.
. Click *Save*.

[[using-tags-for-owner-and-group-quotas]]
===== Using Tags for Owner and Group Quotas

{product-title} provides tags for enforcing quotas for the owners of virtual machines or instances. Ownership of a virtual machine or instance can be set either during the provisioning process or by using the *Configuration Set Ownership* button. If a virtual machine or instance has an owner, the value is displayed in the *Lifecycle* section of the virtual machine or instance summary page.

Quota tags can be assigned directly to *either* a group or owner *not* to a configuration item. The table below shows the tags for use in quotas.

[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",options="header",]
|====
|Category Display Name (Name)|Use
|Quota Max CPU (quota_max_cpu)|Sets the maximum number of CPUs summed over all virtual machines and instances owned by the group or user. Sample Values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
|Quota Max Memory (quota_max_memory)|Sets the maximum memory summed over all virtual machines and instances owned by the group or user. Sample Values: 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 10240, 20480, 40960, 81920 (in MB)
|Quota Max Storage (quota_max_storage)|Sets the maximum storage summed over virtual machines and instances owned by the group or user. Sample Values: 10, 100, 1000, 20, 200, 40, 400 (in GB)
|====

[[applying-a-tag-to-a-user-or-user-group]]
===== Applying a Tag to a User or User Group

. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*.
. Click the *Access Control* accordion, and select the user or group that you want to tag.
. Click image:1941.png[](*Policy*), then click image:1851.png[](*Edit Tags*).
. Select the appropriate customer tag to assign, then the value.
. Click *Save*.

[NOTE]
====
When quotas are applied by both automate instance and tagging, the tagged values will have higher precedence.
====

[[state-machines]]
===== State Machines

The automate state machine processes an ordered list of states. It can ensure the successful completion of a step before the next step is run, permit steps to be retried, allow setting a maximum time to retry the state before exiting, and number of retries before exiting the state.  Before each state is executed, the `On_Entry` method is executed and after the state ends the `On_Exit` or `On_Error` method is executed based on how the state ends.

The following components make up a {product-title} automate state machine:

[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",options="header",]
|====
|Component|Description
|On_Entry|Method to run when entering the state. It enables you to execute an automate method to do some pre-processing before the state of the state machine is processed.
|On_Exit|Method to run when exiting the state.
|On_Error|Method to run if an error is encountered when running the state. It enables you to execute an automate method to do some final processing before the state machine finally exits (MIQ_ABORT) due to the error.
|Default Value|Runs after the On_Entry method completes (The actual state being processed).
|Max Retries|Maximum number of times to retry the state before exiting.
|Max Time|Maximum time in seconds to retry the state before exiting.
|====

In the diagram below, you can see how these components combine to create a state machine workflow.

[NOTE]
====
The retry logic, `On_Entry` and `On_Error` are distinct cases in the program flow.
====

*Code snippet demonstrating the state machine retry logic:*

------
# Get current provisioning status
task = $evm.root['service_template_provision_task']
task_status = task['status']
result = task.status

Then check the result to see how it should proceed:

case result
when 'error'
  $evm.root['ae_result'] = 'error'
.....
when 'retry'
  $evm.root['ae_result'] = 'retry'
  $evm.root['ae_retry_interval'] = '1.minute'
when 'ok'
  $evm.root['ae_result'] = 'ok'
end

When the result is "retry", it sets:
  $evm.root['ae_result'] = 'retry'
  $evm.root['ae_retry_interval'] = '1.minute'
------

The following image shows a simple state machine pertaining to approving a provision request. This instance can be found in menu:Datastore[ManageIQ > Infrastructure > VM > Provisioning > StateMachines > ProvisioningRequestApproval > Default].
image:2354.png[]


. The attribute *max_vms* has a value of 1. State machine processing can use the attributes of the state machine instance to make logic decisions. In this case, the *validate_request* method, which is processed during the *On_Entry* portion of the *ValidateRequest* state, evaluates the *max_vms* attribute. If the number of virtual machines requested is less than the *max_vms* value, the request can be auto-approved.
. *ValidateRequest* is the first state to be executed.
. *ApproveRequest* is the next state to be executed.

[NOTE]
======
Grayed out items reflect values that are set in the class schema. These values can be overwritten on a per instance basis.

[[customizing-provisioning-states]]
===== Customizing Provisioning States

The steps followed when provisioning a virtual machine or cloud instance are completed based on instances from the menu:DOMAIN[Cloud|Infrastructure > VM > Provisioning > StateMachines > VMProvision_VM] class. Depending on your environment you can remove, change, or add steps to the provisioning process. For example, if you are not integrating with IPAM or a CMDB, then you can remove those execution steps.

[[editing-the-default-state-instance]]
===== Editing the Default State Instance

. Navigate to menu:Automate[Explorer].
. From the accordion menu, click menu:DOMAIN[Cloud > VM > Provisioning > StateMachines > VMProvision_VM].
