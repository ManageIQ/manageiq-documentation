{{ site.data.product.title_short }} policies are associated with cloud instances
using virtual machine analysis profiles. These are the steps required to
create a custom virtual machine analysis profile, and assigning it to a
cloud instance for use with SmartState analysis, via a control policy.

**Note:**

For more detailed information about {{ site.data.product.title_short }} policies, see [Assigning a Custom Analysis Profile to a Virtual Machine](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.7/single/assigning-a-custom-analysis-profile-to-a-virtual-machine/)
and [Policies and Profiles Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.7/single/policies-and-profiles-guide/).

The following subsections demonstrate how to create host compliance and instance control policies.

### Creating a Host Compliance Policy

The following procedure describes how to create a compliance policy that checks whether firewalls are enabled on infrastructure provider nodes.
Nodes with disabled firewalls are marked *non-compliant*.

1.  Navigate to **Control > Explorer**.

2.  Expand the **Policies** accordion, and click **Compliance Policies**.

3.  Select **Host Compliance Policies**.

4.  Click ![image](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**),
    ![image](../images/1862.png) (**Add a New Host/Node Compliance Policy**).

5.  Type in a **Description** for the policy.

    ![image](../images/1935.png)

6.  Uncheck **Active** if you do not want this policy processed even when assigned to a resource.

7.  Add **Host / Node.Firewall Rules : Active CONTAINS "true"** to the *scope* of the policy . To do so:

    1.  In drop-down below the **Scope** section, choose **Field**. When you do, a new drop-down will appear below it; from there, select
        **Host/Node.Firewall.Rules: Active**.

    2.  A new drop-down will appear; from there, select **true**.

    3.  Click ![image](../images/1863.png) (**Commit expression element changes**) to add the scope.

8.  In the **Notes** area, add a detailed explanation of the policy.

9.  Click **Add**. The policy will be added and listed under **Host Compliance Policies** in the **Policies** accordion.

Next, create a *policy profile* and assign this new compliance policy to it:

{% include policies-creating-profiles.md %}

At this point, you can now add the new policy profile to the infrastructure provider hosts:

{% include policies-assigning-profiles-to-infra-hosts.md %}

### Creating a Virtual Machine Control Policy

The process of creating a *control policy* is similar to that of a compliance policy. A control policy is driven by events after certain conditions are met. The following control policy will start a SmartState analysis on an instance every 24 hours:

1.  Navigate to **Control > Explorer**.

2.  Expand the **Policies** accordion, and click **Control Policies**.

3.  Select **Vm Control Policies**.

4.  Click ![image](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then
    ![image](../images/1862.png) (**Add a New VM and Instance Control Policy**).

5.  Enter a **Description**. This will be the name given to your VM control policy.

6.  Uncheck **Active** if you do not want this policy processed even when assigned to a resource.

7.  Add **VM and Instance : Last Analysis Time IS "Yesterday"** to the scope of the policy. To do so:

    1.  In drop-down below the **Scope** section, choose **Field**. When you do, a new drop-down will appear below it; from there, select
        **VM and Instance : Last Analysis Time**.

    2.  A new drop-down will appear; from there, select **true**.

    3.  Click ![image](../images/1863.png) (**Commit expression element changes**) to add the scope.

8.  Click **Add**. The policy is added and listed under **Vm Control Policies** in the **Policies** accordion.

You can now associate events, conditions, and actions to this control policy. To do so:

1.  Navigate to **Control > Explorer**.

2.  Click the **Policies** accordion, and select the control policy you just created.

3.  Click ![image](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**),
    ![image](../images/1851.png) (**Edit this Policyâ€™s Condition assignments**).

4.  In the **VM Operation** section, select **VM Power On**.

5.  Click **Save**. The **VM Power On** event should appear under your policy.

You can now associate an action to the **VM Power On** event. To do so:

1.  Select the **VM Power On** event.

2.  Click ![image](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then
    ![image](../images/1851.png) (**Edit Actions for this Policy Event**).

3.  In the **Order of Actions if ALL Conditions are True** section,
    select **Generate Log Message** and **Initiate SmartState Analysis for VM**.

4.  Click **Save**.

Next, create a policy profile and assign this new control policy to it:

1.  Navigate to **Control > Explorer**.

2.  Click on the **Policy Profiles** accordion, then click
    ![image](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then
    ![image](../images/1862.png) (**Add a New Policy Profile**).

3.  Enter `Most Recent SmartState` in the **Description** field.

4.  In the **Policy Selection** area, choose the control policy you
    created earlier. This should have **VM and Instance Control** in its
    name. Add this policy to the **Profile Policies** box.

5.  Click **Add**.

At this point, you should now be able to add the policy profile to the cloud providers.

1.  Navigate to **Compute > Cloud > Providers**.

2.  Select the overcloud you added in [Configuring the Overcloud to Store Events](../managing_providers/index.html#configuring-the-overcloud-to-store-events).

3.  Click ![image](../images/1941.png) (**Policy**), then
    ![image](../images/1851.png) (**Manage Policies**).

4.  Under **Select Policy Profiles**, select **Most Recent SmartState**.

5.  Click **Save**.
