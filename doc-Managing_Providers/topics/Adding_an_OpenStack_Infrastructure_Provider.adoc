= Adding an OpenStack Infrastructure Provider

// see topics/Adding_OpenStack_Providers.adoc for singlesourcable

After initial installation and creation of a {product-title} environment, add an OpenStack Infrastructure provider to the appliance. {product-title} supports operating with the OpenStack `admin` tenant.
When creating an OpenStack Infrastructure provider in {product-title}, select the OpenStack Infrastructure provider's `admin` user because it is the default administrator of the OpenStack `admin` tenant.
When using the `admin` credentials, a user in {product-title} provisions into the `admin` tenant, and sees images, networks, and instances that are associated with the `admin` tenant.


[NOTE]
===================
You can set whether {product-title} should use the Telemetry service or Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) for event monitoring. If you choose Telemetry, you should first configure the *ceilometer* service on the undercloud to store events. See xref:openstack-events-uc[] for instructions.

For more information about OpenStack Telemetry, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/architecture-guide/chapter-1-components#comp-telemetry[OpenStack Telemetry (ceilometer)] from the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/architecture-guide/architecture-guide[Red Hat OpenStack Platform Architecture Guide].
===================


. Navigate to menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Providers].
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then click  image:1862.png[Add a New Infrastructure Provider] (*Add a New Infrastructure Provider*).
. Enter the *Name* of the provider to add.
  The *Name* is how the device is labeled in the console.
. Select *OpenStack Platform Director* from the *Type* list.

. Select the *API Version* of your OpenStack provider's Keystone service from the list. The default is `Keystone v2`.

. Select the appropriate *Zone* for the provider. By default, the zone is set to *default*.

NOTE: For more information, see the definition of host aggregates and availability zones in  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/architecture-guide/chapter-1-components#comp-compute[OpenStack Compute (nova)] from the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/architecture-guide/architecture-guide[Red Hat OpenStack Platform Architecture Guide].

. In the *Default* tab, under *Endpoints*, configure the host and authentication details of your OpenStack provider:
.. Enter the *Host Name or IP address(IPv4 or IPv6)* of the provider. If your provider is an undercloud, use its hostname (see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/director-installation-and-usage/43-setting-the-hostname-for-the-system[Setting the Hostname for the System] from the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/director-installation-and-usage/director-installation-and-usage[Red Hat OpenStack Director Installation and Usage] for more details)
.. In *API Port*, set the public port used by the OpenStack Keystone service. By default, OpenStack uses port 5000 for this.
.. Select the appropriate *Security Protocol* used for authenticating with your OpenStack provider.
.. In the *Username* field, enter the name of an OpenStack user with privileged access (for example, *admin*). Then, provide its corresponding password in the *Password* and *Confirm Password* fields.
.. Click *Validate* to confirm {product-title} can connect to the OpenStack provider.

. Next, configure how {product-title} should receive events from the OpenStack provider. Click the *Events* tab in the *Endpoints* section to start.
* To use the Telemetry service of the OpenStack provider, select *Ceilometer*. Before you do so, the provider must first be configured accordingly. See xref:openstack-events-uc[] for details.
* If you prefer to use the AMQP Messaging bus instead, select *AMQP*. When you do:
 In *Hostname (or IPv4 or IPv6 address)* (of the *Events* tab, under *Endpoints*), enter the public IP or fully qualified domain name of the AMQP host.
** In the *API Port*, set the public port used by AMQP. By default, OpenStack uses port 5672 for this.
** In the *Username* field, enter the name of an OpenStack user with privileged access (for example, *admin*). Then, provide its corresponding password in the *Password* and *Confirm Password* fields.
** Click *Validate* to confirm the credentials.

. You can also configure SSH access to all hosts managed by the OpenStack infrastructure provider. To do so, click on the *RSA key pair* tab in the *Endpoints* section.
.. From there, enter the *Username* of an account with privileged access. 
.. If you selected *SSL* in *Endpoints > Default > Security Protocol* earlier, use the *Browse* button to find and set a private key.

. Click *Add* after configuring the infrastructure provider.


[NOTE]
======
{product-title} requires that the adminURL endpoint for all OpenStack services be on a non-private network.
Accordingly, assign the adminURL endpoint an IP address of something other than `192.168.x.x`.
The adminURL endpoint must be accessible to the {product-title} Appliance that is responsible for collecting inventory and gathering metrics from the OpenStack environment. Additionally, all the Keystone endpoints must be accessible, otherwise refresh will fail.

== Configuring the Undercloud to Store Events

To allow {product-title} to receive events from a Red Hat OpenStack Platform environment, you must configure the *notification_driver* option for the Compute service and Orchestration service in that environment. To do so, edit _undercloud.conf_, and set _store_events_ to _true_ before installing the undercloud. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/director-installation-and-usage/chapter-4-installing-the-undercloud[Installing the Undercloud] and https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/director-installation-and-usage/46-configuring-the-director[Configuring the Director] from the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/director-installation-and-usage/director-installation-and-usage[Red Hat OpenStack Director Installation and Usage] for related details.
