Red Hat CloudForms' integration with ServiceNow enables authentication with an existing ServiceNow database and add/amend items in the ServiceNow database during state machine processing, for example, the VM provision state machine. Note that information in this guide assumes you have credentials and access to a ServiceNow database instance.

The following new namespace and class delivers support for the management of ServiceNow Configuration Management Database (CMDB) records using ServiceNowâ€™s RESTful web service.
