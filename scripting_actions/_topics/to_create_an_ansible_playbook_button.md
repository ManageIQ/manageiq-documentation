### Creating an Ansible Playbook Button

{{ site.data.product.title }} includes an option to create an Ansible Playbook custom
button. This feature allows users to select a playbook to run as well as
an inventory target to run it against. An Ansible playbook type button
can be defined for any object type available.

<div class="note">

An Ansible Playbook catalog item must exist in order to create an Ansible Playbook custom button. For more information, see <a href="https://www.manageiq.org/docs/reference/latest/provisioning_virtual_machines_and_hosts/index.html#creating-an-ansible-playbook-service-catalog-item" target="_blank">Creating an Ansible Playbook Service Catalog Item</a> in the Provisioning Virtual Machines and Hosts guide.

3.  From the **Object Types** tree, select the type of object you want
    to create the button for.

    <div class="note">

    If ![image](../images/1862.png) (**Add a new Button**) is not
    available, that means you have not created a button group for that

    </div>

6.  Select **Ansible Playbook** from the **Button Type** drop-down menu.

7.  From the **Playbook Catalog Item** choose a playbook-backed catalog
    item to run.

8.  Choose a host from the **Inventory** against which to run the
    playbook. If **Specific Hosts** is selected, input the IP address or
    DNS names for each host in the text field, separating each with a
    comma.

    <div class="note">

    {{ site.data.product.title_short }} supports two configurations for host value
    input:

      - To allow user-provided host values, set the custom button to
        **Specific Hosts** and leave the associated text field blank.

      - To use admin-specified host values, remove the **Hosts** field when creating the dialog the service uses. In this
        configuration, the field will not appear to users. See <a href="https://www.manageiq.org/docs/reference/latest/provisioning_virtual_machines_and_hosts/index.html#service-dialogs" target="_blank">Service Dialogs</a> for information on generating a service dialog.
