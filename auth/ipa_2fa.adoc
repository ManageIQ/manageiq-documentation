== 2-Factor Authentication

Enabling 2-Factor Authentication on the Appliance is currently supported
with External Authentication to IPA.

In this guide we will cover how to manually configure a 7.1 Appliance's
external authentication to work with 2-Factor Authentication with IPA.
This provides IPA Users access to the Appliance Administrative UI and the REST API
using their IPA Password followed by a One-Time-Password.

[[requirements]]
== Requirements

The following is needed in order to enable 2-Factor-Authentication to the Appliance:

* A CentOS/RHEL 7.1 based Appliance
* IPA Server based on FreeIPA 4.1.0 or later

[[configure-admin-ui]]
== Configure Administrative UI 

Login as admin, then in _Configure->Configuration->Authentication_

* Set mode to External (httpd)
* Check: _Get User Groups from External Authentication (httpd)_
* Do Not Check: _Enable Single Signon_
** *Note*: Kerberos SSO with OTP is not supported in the current release of FreeIPA 4.1.0 on CentOS/RHEL 7.1
* Click Save.

The above steps need to be done on each UI and WebService enabled appliance.

in _Configure->Configuration->Access Control_

* Make sure the user's groups are created on the Appliance and appropriate roles assigned to those groups.

[[configure-external-auth]]
== Configure External Authentication

Using the Appliance Console, simply enable external authentication as you currently 
would to IPA.

1. Login to console as _root_
2. Run _appliance_console_
3. Summary screen should show *External Auth* as _not configured_, Press any key
4. From the Advanced Setting menu, select the menu item *Configure External Authentication (httpd)*
5. Enter the FQDN of the IPA Server, i.e. _ipaserver.test.company.com_
6. Enter the IPA Server domain, i.e. _test.company.com_
7. Enter the IPA Server realm, i.e. _TEST.COMPANY.COM_
8. Press enter to select the default IPA Server Principal, i.e. _admin_
9. Enter the Password of the IPA Server Principal
10. Review details, and Enter *y* to proceed.

[[enabling-2fa]]
== Enabling 2-Factor Authentication

Enabling 2-Factor Authentication is done using the IPA administrative UI. 

* The IPA administrator needs to change the User authentication types for the user 
from Password or Radius to _Two factor authentication (password + OTP)_
* The previous can be done either per user or for all users from the IPA Server
global Configuration under User Options.
* The user logs into IPA, then from the OTP Tokens tab,
add an OTP token - Time-based (TOTP) or Counter-based (HOTP).
* Specifying a Description for the OTP, then clicking add, brings up a QR Code
which can then be scanned into an app like *FreeOTP* for example.
* Then from the main IPA login screen, the user can Synchronize the OTP Token by
specifying their Username, password and then two OTP's generated from the *FreeOTP* app.
* After which, the user can login to FreeIPA using their Password+OTP.

[[using-2fa]]
== Using 2-Factor Authentication

Once the above is done, the user now needs to specify their IPA Username and
their Password followed by their One-Time-Password as generated by the *FreeOTP* app,
when:

* Logging into the Appliance Administrative UI
* Accessing the REST API
