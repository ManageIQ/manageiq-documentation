= Configuration Management Providers

Currently, {product-title} has two configuration management providers integrated in it to review and monitor the configuration items and changes to them to eliminate the confusion and error brought about by the existence of different providers. These configuration systems are used for recording and reporting status and change activity for these configuration items.

[[red-hat-satellite-6]]
== Red Hat Satellite 6

Satellite 6 is a subscription and system management tool that provides a way to provision hosts (both virtual and bare metal) and configure them using a set of Puppet modules. {product-title} provides functionality to integrate with a Red Hat Satellite 6 server and take advantage of its features. This includes:

* Monitoring the inventory of your Red Hat Satellite 6 server, including independent hosts and hosts provisioned using hostgroups.
* Reprovisioning existing bare metal system hosts to new host groups.
* Applying {product-title} policy tags to hosts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} only reprovisions existing systems in a Red Hat Satellite 6 environment. Provisioning systems from Red Hat Satellite 6's bare metal discovery service is planned for a future release.
