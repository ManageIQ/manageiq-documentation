image:circle_step_numbers/1.png[25,25] You create and run a migration plan in CloudForms.

image:circle_step_numbers/2.png[25,25] CloudForms uses the migration plan to locate the source virtual machines.

image:circle_step_numbers/3.png[25,25] CloudForms captures the ESXi host fingerprint for authentication during the virtual machine conversion process.

ifdef::rhv[]
image:circle_step_numbers/4.png[25,25] Using the attributes defined for the Red Hat Virtualization environment, CloudForms initiates communication with the conversion hosts (Red Hat Virtualization hosts with `virt-v2v` and `virt-v2v-wrapper` installed).
endif::rhv[]
ifdef::osp[]
image:circle_step_numbers/4.png[25,25] Using the attributes defined for the Red Hat OpenStack Platform environment, CloudForms initiates communication with the conversion hosts (Red Hat OpenStack Platform instances created from a conversion host appliance, with `virt-v2v` and `virt-v2v-wrapper` installed).
endif::osp[]

image:circle_step_numbers/5.png[25,25] `virt-v2v-wrapper` connects to the source datastore through the ESXi host. `virt-v2v` streams the source disks to the target data domain and converts the source disks.

ifdef::rhv[]
image:circle_step_numbers/6.png[25,25] `virt-v2v-wrapper` creates a target Red Hat Virtualization virtual machine, using the source virtual machine’s metadata in order to maintain its attributes (tags, power state, MAC address, CPU count, memory, disks, and virtual machine name) after migration.

image:circle_step_numbers/7.png[25,25] `virt-v2v` attaches the converted disks to the Red Hat Virtualization virtual machine. (The virtual machine's power state is the same as the source virtual machine's power state.)
endif::rhv[]
ifdef::osp[]
image:circle_step_numbers/6.png[25,25] After the source disks are converted, `virt-v2v` detaches the volumes from the conversion host, migrates the volumes to the destination project, and creates the network ports defined in the infrastructure mapping.

image:circle_step_numbers/7.png[25,25] `virt-v2v-wrapper` creates the target Red Hat OpenStack Platform instance with the flavor and security group defined in the migration plan. `virt-v2v` attaches the newly created network ports and the disks mapped in the block storage to the instance and the instance is powered on.
endif::osp[]

The migration process is complete and the migration plan’s status is displayed in CloudForms.
