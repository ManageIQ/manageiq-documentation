= Extracting Running Processes from Virtual Machines and Templates

CloudForms Management Engine can collect processes running on Windows virtual machines.
To do this, enter domain credentials for the zone where the virtual machine is located.
For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.1/general-configuration/general-configuration[CloudForms General Configuration guide].
The virtual machine must be running and must have an IP address in the VMDB, usually obtained from a SmartState Analysis.

. Navigate to menu:Infrastructure[Virtual Machines].
. Check the Virtual Machines to collect the processes.
. Click  image:images/1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and then  image:images/2152.png[](*Extract Running Processes*) on the Taskbar.
. Click *OK*.

The server returns the running processes.
