### Copying a Dashboard to a Different Group of Users

As an administrator, it can be useful to share dashboard views with
users who do not have permissions to manage resources.

You can copy a dashboard to another user group by completing the
following steps as an administrative user:

1.  Navigate to **Overview > Reports**.

2.  Click the **Dashboards** accordion, then select the dashboard to
    copy.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) **(Configuration)**, then click
    ![1851](../images/1851.png) **(Copy Selected Dashboard)**.

4.  In the **Basic Information** area, enter a **Name** and
    **Description**.

5.  Select the group to make the dashboard available to.

6.  Click **Save**.

The copied dashboard is now available to all users in the group you
selected.

To view the dashboards available to each group, click the **Dashboards**
accordion, then **All Dashboards > All Groups**, and click the group to
see a list.
