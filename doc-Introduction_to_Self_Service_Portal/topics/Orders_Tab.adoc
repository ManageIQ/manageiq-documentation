== The Orders Tab

The *Orders* tab lists all shopping cart orders of services added from the *Service Catalog*. The tab shows a summary of each order, including the order number, requester, order date, and the number of items. Click on the arrow next to an order number to further expand and see the request associated with the order, and additional details including the request ID, whether its approved or denied, and the current state of the request. You can filter or sort the orders listed on the page using the buttons at the top of the screen.
