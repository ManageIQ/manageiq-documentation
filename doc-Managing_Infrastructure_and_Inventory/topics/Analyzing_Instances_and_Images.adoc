= Analyzing Instances and Images with SmartState Analysis

Analyze an instance to collect metadata such as user accounts, applications, software patches, and other internal information.
If {product-title} is not set up for automatic analysis, perform a manual analysis of an instance.
To perform a SmartState Analysis, {product-title} requires a running SmartProxy with visibility to the instance's storage location so that a snapshot can be created.

[IMPORTANT]

For example, a successful SmartState Analysis of a host does not mean SmartState Analysis for instances will be successful.
Ensure to enter credentials for the provider that contains the instance for the SmartState Analysis to work.
