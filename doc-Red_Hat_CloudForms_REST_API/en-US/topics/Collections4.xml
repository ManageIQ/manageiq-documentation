	<title>Collections</title>
	<para>
		Resources can be grouped into collections. Each collection is unordered, and is homogeneous so that it contains only one type of resource. Resources can also exist outside any collection; these resources are referred to as singleton resources. Collections are themselves resources as well.
	</para>
	<para>
		Collections can exist globally, at the top level of an API, and can also be contained inside a single resource. The latter are referred to as sub-collections. Sub-collections are usually used to express a relationship where one resource is contained within another.
	</para>
	<para>
		Collections are serialized in JSON in the following way:
	</para>
	<programlisting>
{
  &quot;name&quot; : &quot;String&quot;,
  &quot;count&quot;: String,
  &quot;subcount&quot;: String,
  &quot;resources&quot;: [ ... ],
  &quot;actions&quot;: [ ... ]
}
</programlisting>
	<para>
		The <literal>count</literal> attribute in a collection always denotes the total number of items in the collection, not the number of items returned. The <literal>subcount</literal> attribute in a collection depicts the number of items returned. The <literal>resources</literal> attribute is an Array[T], where T might be a list of references to the T or, if expanded, a list of resources with all attributes. The <literal>actions</literal> attribute contains an Array of actions that can be performed against the collection resources.
