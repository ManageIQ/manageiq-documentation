== Understanding the Automate Model

Automate enables real-time, bi-directional process integration. This provides users with a method to implement adaptive automation for management events and administrative or operational activities.

[[relationships]]
=== Relationships

Relationships are used to connect to other instances in the *Automation
Datastore*. Relationships are formed using URI syntax. The following can
also be passed through a relationship:

* Use `#` to set the message to send to the item in the relationship.
* To pass an input to the method use `?` followed by the item to pass.
* If you want to use a substitution, the syntax is `$\{}` with the
substitution located between the brackets.

|====
|Example |Explanation
|`/Cloud/VM/Provisioning/Naming/Default#create` |This relationships uses
the Default instance of the Naming class, which provides a means for
other classes to name virtual machines. The relationship sends the
`create` message to the class.

|`/Cloud/VM/Provisioning/StateMachines/VMProvision_VM/AcquireMACAddress#$\{#ae_message}`
|This relationships substitutes the message to send to the
AcquireMACAddress instance of the VMProvision_VM class with the value in
`ae_message`.

|`/Cloud/VM/Retirement/Email/vm_retirement_emails?event=vm_retired`
|Invokes the vm_retirement_emails instance of the Email class. Also
sends the value `vm_retired` in the `event` attribute, which is used in
the vm_retirement_emails method.

|`/Service/Lifecycle/Retirement?service_id=$\{process#service_id}`
|Invokes the Retirement instance of the Lifecycle class and send a
replacement value in `process#service_id` to the `service_id` attribute.

[[methods]]
=== Methods

Methods are pieces of code associated with a class or object to perform
a task. {product-title} allows for Ruby methods or backing a method using an Ansible playbook. You can
create your own methods or use relationships to link to pre-existing
ones. 

{product-title} ships with a core set of Ruby gems used by the
{product-title} Rails Application. The Ruby gems in this
set are subject to change. If you are calling gems using
Automate that are no longer in this release, you can install them by using the `gem install` command.

While gems can be imported into automation methods using `require`, it
is recommended that the authors of the automation methods clearly
document the use of gems either in the core set or a custom set. It is
the responsibility of the author of such custom automation to own the
life cycle of any gem being referenced in those methods.

The Release Notes list Ruby gems that have been added, updated, or
removed in the latest version of {product-title}.

[[simulation]]
=== Simulation

After your model is designed, use the simulate page to test it. It
allows you to see the results in tree and XML view.

[[importing-exporting-and-resetting-the-datastore]]
=== Importing, Exporting, and Resetting the Datastore

The *Automate Model* can be exported and imported as a YAML file.
{product-title} allows you to back up your model by export. Red Hat may provide you with new or updated classes, and provides an import function for either a class or the entire model. Finally, you can reset the datastore to its default. Always be sure to export the current datastore before importing or resetting.
