When enabling metrics on OpenShift Container Platform, you can store your metrics data on _persistent_ or _non-persistent_ storage. To use persistent storage, you need to provision a persistent volume specifically for this purpose before xref:ocp-metrics-storage[configuring the metrics components]. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise/version-3.2/architecture/#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[Persistent Volumes] in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise/version-3.2/architecture/[OpenShift Container Platform Architecture documentation] for more information.
