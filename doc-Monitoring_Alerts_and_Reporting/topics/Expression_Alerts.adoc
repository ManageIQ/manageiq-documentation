= Creating an Expression Alert

Expression alerts enables you to create a notification based on any possible criteria for clusters, datastores, hosts, and virtual machines.
In the example below, we look for a host whose datastore has less than 5% free space.

* Type in a description for the alert. 
* From [label]#Based On#, select [label]#Host#. 
* For [label]#What to Evaluate#, select [label]#Expression (Custom)#. 
* In [label]#Notification Frequency#, select how often you want to be notified if the expression is evaluated to true. 

. Use the expression editor to create your expression.
  This is the same expression editor used to create Conditions.
