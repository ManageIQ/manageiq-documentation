					Red Hat CloudForms now provides the capability of enabling providers based on subscription/certificates, which allows its shipping as a bundled product with other SKU’s such as OpenStack with CloudForms and OpenShift with CloudForms. Having other streams available for the delivery of Red Hat CloudForms increases adoption and provides advanced management capabilities to the users.

			<term>Event Switchboard</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Red Hat CloudForms now has better visibility and normalization of the event handling capabilities through the introduction of a new feature, Event Switchboard. Event switchboard automates the provider events and miq policy events by handling them via automate. A new class EventStream is added to be the parent class of all event classes. Whenever an event comes in, an EventStream object is sent to automate that kicks off the event handling process. An EmsEvent instance contains all information about its VM, host and provider related to the event.
				</para>
				<para>
				The Event Switchboard delivers the following capabilities:

			<term>Pluggable Providers</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Red Hat CloudForms now provides the ability to vendors to write their own providers for Red Hat CloudForms using community available practices and documentation. Previously, Red Hat Insight was used to help stickiness with existing Red Hat accounts by supplying detailed information about security vulnerabilities as well as tuning recommendations. In Red Hat CloudForms 4.0, there is no sharing of data between Red Hat CloudForms and the Red Hat Insights plugin. Red Hat Insights is used as a pluggable UI module to the Red Hat CloudForms user interface. 
				</para>
				<para>
				The Pluggable providers provide the following enhancement to Red Hat CloudForms:
					<itemizedlist>
