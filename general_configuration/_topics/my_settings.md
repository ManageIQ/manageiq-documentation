    list:

        to all users. Only the super administration and administration
        roles can create, edit, and delete a global profile.

The following relationships exist between time zones and performance
reports:

  - The configured time zone in a performance report is used to select
    rolled up performance data, regardless of the user’s selected time
    zone.

  - If the configured time zone is null, it defaults to UTC time for
    performance reports.

  - If there is no time profile with the report’s configured time zone
    that is also set to roll up capacity and utilization data, the
    report does not find any records.

For non-performance reports, the user’s time zone is used when displaying dates and times in report rows.
