= Configuring the conversion hosts

ifdef::rhv[]
.Prerequisites

* If the Red Hat Virtualization provider has been active for a while, verify that the hosts have valid subscriptions and repositories:
+
----
# subscription-manager list --consumed
# yum repolist
----

* If a host has an SSH private key in `/var/lib/vdsm/.ssh/id_rsa`, delete the key manually before configuring the host. Conversion host configuration does not overwrite existing keys.
endif::rhv[]

The Manager deploys a private SSH key on the conversion hosts in order to send commands and run playbooks. The default key file is `/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/engine_id_rsa` on the Manager machine.
endif::rhv[]
ifdef::osp[]
The Red Hat OpenStack Platform user uses a private SSH key to connect to the conversion hosts.
endif::osp[]

.. Select *SSH* as the *Transformation method*.
.. Click *Browse* to browse to the SSH private key you created for enabling SSH access on the VMware hypervisors or paste it in the *VMware hypervisors SSH private key* field.

The configured conversion hosts and status information, including error messages, appear in the *Configured Conversion Hosts* list.

If an error occurs, you can download a host's log by clicking the *More Actions* icon (image:More_actions_icon.png[7]) and selecting *Download Log*.

You can click the *Retry* button if the conversion host configuration failed for reasons unconnected with your environment.

(Optional) Click *Remove* to remove the configuration from a configured conversion host.
