In xref:provisioning-an-openstack-instance-from-an-image[], you provisioned instance manually by entering values in provisioning dialogs such as name, size, image, CPUs, etc. _Catalogs_ are used to create groups of instances for provisioning. {product-title_short} enables users to provision instances via a single *Order* button.

Creating a _service catalog_ involves:

. Creating a *Service Dialog*. This is a UI interface element that allows users to interact with the service (for example, a drop-down list).

. Creating a *Catalog Item* for each instance that will be part of the service. 

. Creating a _method_ for the *Service Dialog*. This method defines what each option means to each individual cloud instances for the service. This method is called from a service provisioning instance in the *Automate* model.

[[adding-a-service-dialog]]
=== Creating a Service Dialog

When provisioning a service, input will be needed from the requester. *Service Dialogs* are used to take input from the user. This input is connected to a method in the *Automate* model that defines how user input is translated into the provision request. Before creating a *Service Dialog*, be sure to plan what items you need the user to input.
