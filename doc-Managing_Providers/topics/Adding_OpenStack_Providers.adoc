= Adding OpenStack Providers

CloudForms Management Engine supports operating with the OpenStack "admin" tenant.
When creating an OpenStack provider in CloudForms Management Engine, select the OpenStack provider's admin user because it is the default administrator of the OpenStack admin tenant.
When using the admin credentials, a user in CloudForms Management Engine provisions into the admin tenant, and sees images, networks, and instances that are associated with the admin tenant.

[NOTE]
======
In order to collect inventory and metrics from an OpenStack environment, the CloudForms Management Engine Appliance requires that the adminURL endpoint for the OpenStack environment should be on a non-private network.
Hence, the OpenStack adminURL endpoint should be assigned an IP address other than [literal]+192.168.x.x+.

[NOTE]
======
For Red Hat CloudForms to be able to receive events from a Red Hat OpenStack provider, the OpenStack configuration file must be modified. Specifically, the [label]#notification_driver# field must be defined.

For Nova and Heat, in order to start getting notifications, manually change the configuration files as below and restart services.

------
/etc/heat/heat.conf
notification_driver=glance.openstack.common.notifier.rpc_notifier
notification_topics=notifications

/etc/nova/nova.conf
notification_driver=messaging
notification_topics=notifications
