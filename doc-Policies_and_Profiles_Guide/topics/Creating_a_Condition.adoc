=== Creating a Condition

You can create a condition either from within a policy screen or by going directly to the expression editor in the {product-title} console. You need to define a description and an expression element. The expression element defines what criteria you want to use to
test the condition.

** *Check Any*: The result is true if one or more of the find results satisfy the check condition.
