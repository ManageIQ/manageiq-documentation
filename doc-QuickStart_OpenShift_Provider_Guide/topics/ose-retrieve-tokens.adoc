After enabling cluster metrics on your OpenShift Enterprise deployment, retrieve the _management token_ while you are still logged into the OpenShift Enterprise host. This will be required later in xref:integration[].

Refer to the procedure appropriate for your version of OpenShift Enterprise:

.OpenShift Enterprise 3.2

include::common/provider-ose-mgt-token-3_2.adoc[]

This command provides the token needed to add an OpenShift Enterprise provider.

.OpenShift Enterprise 3.1

include::common/provider-ose-mgt-token-3_1.adoc[]

This command provides the token needed to add an OpenShift Enterprise provider.
