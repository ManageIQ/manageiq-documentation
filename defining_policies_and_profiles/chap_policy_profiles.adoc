=== Simulating Policy

Before assigning a policy profile to a virtual machine, use the
{product-title} controls policy simulation feature to
determine if a virtual machine passes a policy profile.

=== Assigning Policy Profiles

After creating your policy profiles, you are ready to evaluate and
assign them. Policy profiles are assigned to virtual machines,
providers, clusters, hosts, resource pools, and repositories. Policies
within a profile run either on a Host or virtual machine based on the
type of policy created.

* Assign a policy profile to a virtual machine to apply the policy
profile to a specific virtual machine, independent of its related host,
provider, or repository.
* Assign a policy profile to a provider to apply the policy profile to
all virtual machines or hosts registered to that provider.
* Assign a policy profile to a cluster to apply the policy profile to
all virtual machines or hosts assigned to that cluster.
* Assign a VM policy profile to a host to apply the policy profile to
that specific host or all virtual machines registered to that Host.
* Assign a VM policy profile to a resource pool to apply the policy
profile to all virtual machines or hosts assigned to that resource pool.
* Assign a VM policy profile to a repository to apply the policy profile
to all virtual machines registered to that repository.
