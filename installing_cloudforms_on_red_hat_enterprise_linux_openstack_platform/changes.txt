Before installing an internal database, add a disk to the infrastructure hosting your appliance. See the documentation specific to your infrastructure for instructions on how to add a disk. As a storage disk usually cannot be added while a virtual machine is running, Red Hat recommends adding the disk before starting the appliance. {product-title} only supports installing of an internal VMDB on blank disks. The installation will fail if the disks are not blank.

=== Configuring an External Database

The `postgresql.conf` file used with {product-title} databases requires specific settings for correct operation. For example, it must correctly reclaim table space, control session timeouts, and format the PostgreSQL server log for improved system support. Due to these requirements, it is recommended that external {product-title} databases use a `postgresql.conf` file based on the standard file used by the {product-title} Appliance.
