    - Use the **Interval** dropdown to select hourly or daily data points.

    - Use **Date** to type the date of the timeline to display.

    - If viewing a daily timeline, use **Show** to set how many days back to go. The maximum history is 31 days.

    - The three **Event Group** dropdowns allow selection of different event groups to display. Each has its own color.

    - From the **Level** dropdown, select either a **Summary** event or a **Detail** list of events. For example, the detail level of a **Power On** event might include the power on request, the starting event, and the actual **Power On** event. If you select **Summary**, you only see the **Power On** event in the timeline.

5. To see more detail on an item in the timeline, click on it. A balloon
   appears with a clickable link to the resource.
