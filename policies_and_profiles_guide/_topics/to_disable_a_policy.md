### Disabling a Policy in a Policy Profile

You can disable one policy in a profile without removing it from the
policy, perhaps for trouble shooting purposes or because the policy is
not required temporarily.

1. Browse to menu: **Control > Explorer**.

2. Click the **Policies** accordion, then navigate to the policy that
    you need to disable or navigate to the policy from the policy
    profile.

3. Click ![image](../images/1847.png)**Configuration**,
    ![image](../images/1851.png)**Edit Basic Info, Scope, Notes**.

4. Uncheck **Active**.

5. Click **Save**.
