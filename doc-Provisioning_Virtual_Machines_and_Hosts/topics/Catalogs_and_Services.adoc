=== About Catalogs and Services

Through the use of catalogs, {product-title} provides support for multi-tier service provisioning to deploy layered workloads across hybrid environments. You can create customized dialogs that will give consumers of the services the ability to input just a few parameters and provision the entire service.

=== Terminology

*Terminology*

*Catalog Bundle*:: A grouping of Templates.
*Catalog Item*:: A single Template or a group of Templates (catalog bundle).
*Dialog Tabs*:: Part of a Service Dialog.
*Element*:: An item on a tab in a Dialog. It can be a Button, Check Box, Drop Down List, Radio Button, Tag Control, Text Area Box, or a Text Box.
*Provisioning Dialogs*:: Dialogs created for Host Provisioning, VM Migration, or VM Provisioning. The dialog name must be added to the appropriate provision instance to be processed.
*Service Catalog*:: A catalog item or Catalog bundle that is available for provisioning.
*Service Dialogs*:: Made up of fully customizable tabs, items, and values for use with Service provisioning.
*Template*:: A template is a copy of a preconfigured virtual machine, designed to capture installed software and software configurations, as well as the hardware configuration, of the original virtual machine.

=== Catalogs

==== Catalogs

Catalogs are used to create groups of virtual machines or instances for provisioning. For example, a complete package of a database server, desktop with specialized software already on it, and a firewall. You will need to complete the following steps to create and provision a service catalog.

. Create *Catalog Items* for each virtual machine or instance that will be part of the service.
. Create a *Service* dialog. For example, create a dropdown with three options small, medium, and large.
. Create a method for the Service Dialog. This method defines what each of the options means to each of the individual virtual machines or cloud instances for the service. This method is called from a service provisioning instance in the Automate model.
. Create an instance in the `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template` class that calls the method.
+
[NOTE]
======
DOMAIN must be a user-defined Domain and not the locked ManageIQ Domain. If necessary, you can copy the class from the ManageIQ domain into a custom domain.
======
+
. Associate method with Automate instance.
. Create a *Catalog Bundle*, adding each of the catalog items to it. Select the *Service Dialog* you created. Use the instance created in the `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template` class as the *Entry Point*. Check *Display in Catalog* box.
. Provision a service.

==== Creating a Catalog Item

Create a catalog item for each virtual machine or cloud instance that will be part of the service.

. Navigate to menu:Services[Catalogs].
. Click the *Catalog Items* accordion.
. Click image:1847.png[](*Configuration*), and then image:1862.png[](*Add a New Catalog Item*).
. Select the *Catalog Item Type* you are adding. The dialogs that appear will be filtered based on the selected type of provider. For example, you will only see templates residing on Red Hat Providers, if the *Catalog Item Type* is *Redhat*.
image:2357.png[]
. In the *Basic Info* subtab:
.. Type a *Name/Description*.
.. Check *Display in Catalog* to edit *Catalog*, *Dialog*, and *Entry Point(NS/Cls/Inst)* options.
... *Provisioning Entry Point (Domain/NS/Cls/Inst)* requires you to select an Automate instance to run upon provisioning.
... *Retirement Entry Point (Domain/NS/Cls/Inst)* requires you to select an Automate instance to run upon retirement.
image:Catalogitem-statemachine.png[]
+
[NOTE]
======
The entry point must be a State Machine since the *Provisioning Entry Point* list is filtered to only show State Machine class instances. No other entry points will be available from the *Provisioning Entry Point* field.
======
+
[NOTE]
======
You can only choose from the catalogs and dialogs you have already created. If you haven't done so, leave the values blank and edit later.
======
+
. In the *Details* subtab, write a *Long Description* for the catalog item.
. In the *Request Info* subtab, select provisioning options that apply to the provider chosen. For more information, refer to the sections on Provisioning Virtual Machines and Provisioning Instances.
. Click *Add*.


==== Service Dialogs

When provisioning a service, input will be needed from the requester. *Service Dialogs* are used to take input from the user. This input is connected to a method in the *Automate* model that defines how the users input is translated into the provision request. Before creating a *Service Dialog*, be sure to plan what items you need the user to input.

===== Adding a Service Dialog

. Navigate to menu:Automate[Customization].
. Click the *Service Dialogs* accordion.
. Click image:1847.png[](*Configuration*), and then image:1862.png[](*Add a new Dialog*).
. In *Dialog Information*, type in a *Label* and *Description*. Check the boxes for the buttons you want available at the bottom of the dialog form. The description will appear as hover text.
. Click *Add*.
. Select the dialog you just created.
. Click image:1847.png[](*Configuration*), and then image:1851.png[](*Edit this Dialog*).
. Add a tab to the dialog.
.. Click image:1862.png[](*Add*), then image:1862.png[](*Add a New Tab to this Dialog*).
.. Type in a *Label* and *Description* for this tab.
. Add a box to this tab.
.. Click image:1862.png[](*Add*), then image:1862.png[](*Add a New Box to this Tab*).
.. Type in a *Label* and *Description* for this box.
. Add an element to this box. Elements are controls that accept input.
.. Click image:1862.png[](*Add*), then image:1862.png[](*Add a New Element to this Box*).
.. Type in a *Label*, *Name*, and *Description* for this element.
+
[IMPORTANT]
======
*Name* must use only alphanumeric characters and underscores without spaces. It is also used to retrieve the value of this element in the method used with the dialog and must start with *dialog_service_type*
======
+
.. Select a *Type* for an element type. All *Type* options have a *Required* and *Default Value* field. Check *Required* or set *Required* to *true* if the element is required to proceed. You can also specify a default value. The rest of the options presented are based on which type of element you select.
+
[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Element Types|Additional Info
|Check Box|Check *Default Value* if you want this check box checked by default.
|Date Control|Use *Date Control* to create a field where users can select a date. If you want users to be able to select a date and time, use the *Date/Time Control* option.
|Date/Time Control|Use *Date/Time Control* to create a field where users can select a date and time. Only one *Date Control* or *Date/Time Control* element can be present in a dialog.
|Drop Down Dynamic List|Use *Drop Down Dynamic List* if you want the list options to be created using automate methods. Use *Entry Point (NS/Cls/Inst)* to select an automate instance. Check *Show Refresh Button* to allow users to refresh the list options manually.
|Radio Button|This element type serves the same purpose as *Drop Down List* but displays options using radio buttons.
|Tag Control|Select a *Category* of tags you want assigned to the virtual machines associated with this service dialog. Check *Single Select* if only one tag can be selected.
|Text Area Box|Provides text area for users to type in some text. You can also leave a message to users by typing in the *Default Value* field or leave it as blank.
|Text Box|This element type serves the same purpose as *Text Area Box* with the option to check *Protected* so the text is shown as asterisks (*), instead of plain text.
|=======================================================================
+
. Click *Save*.

===== Importing Service Dialogs

You can share service dialogs between appliances using the export and import features.

. Navigate to menu:Automate[Customization].
. In the *Import/Export* accordion, click *Service Dialog Import/Export*.
. In the *Import* area, click *Browse* to select an import file.
. Click *Upload*.

===== Exporting Service Dialogs

You can share service dialogs between appliances using the export and import features.

. Navigate to *Automate → Customization*.
. In the *Import/Export* accordion, click *Service Dialog Import/Export*.
. In the *Export* area, select the service dialogs that you want to export.
. Click *Export*.

==== Methods

===== Creating a Method to Associate with the Dialog

You will need to create a method that connects the values in the dialog with the provisioning request. The method should be created in the `DOMAIN/Service/Provisioning/StateMachines/ServiceProvision_Template` class of the *Automate* model.

[NOTE]
======
*DOMAIN* must be a user-defined Domain and not the locked ManageIQ Domain. If necessary, you can copy the class from the ManageIQ domain into a custom domain.
======

A method is provided below that was created for the following scenario:

* You want to provision a three-tiered Service that contains catalog items of web, app and DB. Each of these virtual machines (or cloud instances) has been tagged under the *Service* category with the appropriate value. Then, added as a catalog item and combined into a catalog bundle.
* The *Service Dialog* captures the selection of small, medium or large application in a dropdown called *service_type*. When referring to a value captured in an element in a dialog, the name of the element should be prefixed with *dialog_*. For example, *service_type* becomes *dialog_service_type* when used in the method.
* The method will set the memory sizes for each of the catalog items based on the *service_type* selection.
