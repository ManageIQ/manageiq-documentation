= Detecting Drift on Hosts

Over time, the configuration of a host might change.
Drift is the comparison of a host to itself at different points in time.
The host requires analysis at least twice to collect information.
Detecting drift provides you the following benefits:

* See the difference between the last known state of a host and its current state.
* Review the configuration changes that happen to a particular host between multiple points in time.
* Capture the configuration drifts for a single host across a time period.

Detect drift on hosts:

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Hosts].
. Click on the host to view drift.
. Click *Relationships* in the host accordion.
. Click *Drift History*.
. Check the analyses to compare.
. Click  image:1946.png[] (*Drift*) at the top of the screen.
  The results display.
. Check the *Comparison* sections on the left to view in your comparison.
. Click *Apply*.
. Click the plus sign next to the sections name to expand it.
+
* An item displayed on red text shows a change from the base analysis.
  An item displayed in black text shows no change from the base analysis.
* A  image:2177.png[] (*Changed from previous*) shows a change since the last analysis.
* A  image:2150.png[] (*Same as previous*) means no change since the last analysis.
* Click  image:1861.png[] (*Remove from drift*) at the bottom of a column to remove a specific analysis.
  The drift recalculates and the new results display.

. Click  image:2023.png[] (*Expanded View*) to see the expanded view.
  Click  image:2024.png[] (*Compressed View*) to compress the information.
. Click the minus sign next to the sections name to collapse it.
. To limit the type of views, you have three buttons in the taskbar:
+
* Click  image:2178.png[] (*All attributes*) to see all attributes of the sections you selected.
* Click  image:2204.png[] (*Attributes with different values*) to see only the attributes that are different across the drifts.
* Click  image:2148.png[] (*Attributes with the same values*) to see only the attributes that are the same across drifts.

The drift comparison displays.
