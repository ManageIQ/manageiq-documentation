== Integration with AWS CloudFormation and OpenStack Heat

{product-title} integration with AWS CloudFormation and OpenStack Heat provides an ability to:

* Inventory all *AWS CloudFormation* and *OpenStack Heat* stacks and elements into *CFME's VMDB*.
* Model the relationships of instances to their stacks, inclusive of the UI. Example, selecting an instance within a region that is within a stack, the UI shows this on the standard instance view.
* Model the stack and its elements in the UI.

[NOTE]
======
When importing a template into {product-title}, the selected elements are converted according to their type. For example, lists convert to list boxes, and single items convert to text boxes.
