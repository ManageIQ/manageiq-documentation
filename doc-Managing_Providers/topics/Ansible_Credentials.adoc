= Credentials

Credentials are utilized by {product-title} for authentication when running Ansible playbooks against machines, synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

== Adding Credentials
{product-title} can store credentials used by playbooks. Credentials saved in {product-title_short} are matched and executed with a playbook when run.   

[IMPORTANT]
====
If both {product-title_short} and a VMware provider are located in the same IPv6-only network, use a DNS-resolvable hostname for the VMware provider in the *vCenter Host* field when adding credentials.
====

. Navigate to menu:Automation[Ansible > Credentials].
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then  image:1862.png[Add a New Credential] (*Add a New Credential*).

== Credential Types
Each credential type used by {product-title_short} is detailed in the following sections. 

=== Machine

Machine credentials enable {product-title_short} to invoke Ansible on hosts under your management. Just like using Ansible on the command line, you can specify the SSH username, optionally provide a password, an SSH key, or a key password. They define SSH and user-level privilege escalation access for playbooks, and are used when running playbooks on a remote host.

* *Username*: The username to be used for SSH authentication.
* *Password*: The actual password to be used for SSH authentication. 
* *SSH Private Key*: Copy or drag-and-drop the SSH private key for the machine credential.
* *Private Key Passphrase*: If the SSH Private Key used is protected by a password, you can configure a Key Password for the private key. 
* *Privilege Escalation*: Specifies the type of escalation privilege to assign to specific users. Options include *sudo*, *su*, *pbrun*, *pfexec*.
* *Privilege Escalation Username*: Enter the username to use with escalation privileges on the remote system.
* *Privilege Escalation Password*: Enter the actual password to be used to authenticate the user via the selected privilege escalation type on the remote system. 
* *Vault Password*: Ansible Vault credentials have only the *Vault Password* attribute that may be configured.
