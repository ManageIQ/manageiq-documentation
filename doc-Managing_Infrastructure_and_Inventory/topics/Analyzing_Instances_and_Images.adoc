= Analyzing Instances and Images

Analyze an instance to collect metadata such as user accounts, applications, software patches, and other internal information.
If CloudForms Management Engine is not set up for automatic analysis, perform a manual analysis of an instance.
To perform a SmartState Analysis, CloudForms Management Engine requires a running SmartProxy with visibility to the instance's storage location.
