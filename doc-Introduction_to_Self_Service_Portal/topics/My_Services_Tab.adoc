== The My Services Tab

The *My Services* tab lists all available services with a summary of information associated with each service, including the *Service Name*, its current *Power State* represented by an icon, *Number of VMs*, *Owner*, date *Created*, and *Retires* date. Additionally, you can see the chargeback cost per service for a virtual machine's month-to-date usage. You can filter or sort services by those entities, and by *Relative Cost*. 

On the same screen, you have the option to edit the service name and description, edit tags, set ownership, retire the service now or at a later date, or remove the service. You can also perform power operations on virtual machines by clicking more options _(represented by three dots)_ next to the service.

A snapshot is a copy of the virtual machine's disk file (VMDK) that captures the entire state of the virtual machine at a point in time. Use *Revert* under more options _(represented by three dots)_ to return a virtual machine to a previous state when you took the snapshot.

=== Cockpit Integration

Cockpit is an interactive Linux server administrative interface. You can perform simple administration tasks such as starting containers, storage administration, network configuration, and inspecting logs. While Cockpit allows you to monitor and administer several servers at the same time, your browser connects to a primary server that runs the Cockpit web service through which connections to additional servers can be established.

The {product-title} full administrative user interface and the Self Service user interface have enabled for users to access the Cockpit interface for a given virtual machine. 

==== Accessing the Cockpit Interface
