== Planning

This guide provides some general guidelines to planning a deployment on {product-title}. This includes creating multiple regions containing {product-title} appliances, CPU sizing recommendations, database sizing recommendations, and database configuration.

[[regions]]
=== Regions

Regions are used for centralizing data which is collected from public and private virtualization environments. A region is ultimately represented as a single database for the VMDB. Regions are particularly useful when multiple geographical locations need to be managed, as they enable all the data collection to happen at each particular location and avoid data collection traffic across slow links between networks.

When multiple regions are being used, each with their own unique ID, a master region can be created to centralize the data of all the children regions into a single master database. To do this, configure each child region to replicate its data to the master region database (Red Hat recommends use of region 99). This parent and child region is a one-to-many relationship.

Regions can contain multiple zones, which in turn contain appliances. Zones are used for further segregating network traffic along with enabling failover configurations. Each appliance has the capability to be configured for a number of specialized server roles. These roles are limited to the zone containing the appliance they run on.

Only one failover type of each server role can run in a zone. If multiple appliances have the same failover role, the extras are used as backups that activate only if the primary appliance fails. Non-failover server roles can run on multiple appliances simultaneously in a zone, so resources can be adjusted according to the workload those roles are responsible for.

The following diagram demonstrates an example of the multiple regions working together in a {product-title} environment.

The Master appliance is located in Chicago and contains a master region and a subregion that manages the worker appliances. The Mahwah technology center contains a single subregion that manages two zones.
Likewise, the San Diego technology center contains a single subregion managing a single zone.

[NOTE]
====
* Replicating a parent region to a higher-level parent is not supported.
* Parent regions can be configured after the child regions are online.
====

The following diagram provides a closer look at a region:

In this region, we have several {product-title} appliances acting as UI nodes and worker nodes. These worker nodes execute tasks on the providers in your environment.
The Region also uses a region database that reports to a master database on the main {product-title} appliance. All appliances can connect to the authentication services (Active Directory, LDAP, Identity Management), outgoing mail (SMTP), and network services (SNMP).


[[tenants]]
=== Tenants

{product-title} supports multi-tenancy, letting you isolate one tenant's resources and user accounts from another. In addition, tenants can be nested in a hierarchy, enabling those at the bottom to inherit permissions from those above. This configuration allows for granular user permissions to be set on specific tenants.

Tenancy Models::

A number of approaches exist for tenant planning:

* *Tenantless* - Similar to the previous system without tenancy support, you can create a single large tenant and perform all your operations in there without any subdivision of resources or user accounts.
* *Enterprise model* - A common scenarios is to create a single tenant, and then subdivide it based on the structures or departments within your organization. Those departments are then able to further subdivide their resources into distinct projects. With this model, you have a single URL for user access, while still having the ability to divide resources into nested hierarchical tenants.
* *Multiple tenant model (CCP)* - Created with Certified Cloud Providers in mind, this model allows multiple tenants to enjoy complete isolation from other tenants, with separate branding and unique URLs.

=== Example PostgreSQL Configuration File

------
# -----------------------------
# PostgreSQL configuration file - MIQ Dedicated Appliance Configuration
# -----------------------------
#
# This file consists of lines of the form:
#
#   name = value
#
# (The "=" is optional.)  Whitespace may be used.  Comments are introduced with
# "#" anywhere on a line.  The complete list of parameter names and allowed
# values can be found in the PostgreSQL documentation.
#
# The commented-out settings shown in this file represent the default values.
# Re-commenting a setting is NOT sufficient to revert it to the default value;
# you need to reload the server.
#
# This file is read on server startup and when the server receives a SIGHUP
# signal.  If you edit the file on a running system, you have to SIGHUP the
# server for the changes to take effect, or use "pg_ctl reload".  Some
# parameters, which are marked below, require a server shutdown and restart to
# take effect.
#
# Any parameter can also be given as a command-line option to the server, e.g.,
# "postgres -c log_connections=on".  Some parameters can be changed at run time
# with the "SET" SQL command.
#
# Memory units:  kB = kilobytes        Time units:  ms  = milliseconds
#                MB = megabytes                     s   = seconds
