== Defining the Hostgroup Hierarchy

Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine displays the Red Hat Satellite 6 infrastructure in a host group and host relationship. A host group defines a set of default values that hosts inherit when placed in that group. Hosts can belong to only one host group, but host groups can be nested in hierarchies. You can create a *"base"* or *"parent"* host group that represents all hosts in your organization, and then create nested or *"child"* host groups under that parent to provide specific settings.
