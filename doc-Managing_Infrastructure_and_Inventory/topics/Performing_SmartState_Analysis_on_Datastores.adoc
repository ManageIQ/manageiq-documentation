= Performing SmartState Analysis on Datastores

Analyze a datastore to collect information on the types of files on a datastore, and to see the number of managed/registered, managed/unregistered, and unmanaged virtual machines.
To perform a SmartState analysis, the datastore is accessible from a running host and valid security credentials are supplied for that host.

[NOTE]
====
Be aware that executing a SmartState analysis on a datastore from the console takes a while to return data on the content.
If capacity and utilization roles are enabled, {product-title} performs the analysis automatically on a scheduled basis approximately every 24 hours.
