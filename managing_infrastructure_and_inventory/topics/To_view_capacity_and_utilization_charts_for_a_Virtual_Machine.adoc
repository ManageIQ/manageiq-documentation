= Viewing Capacity and Utilization Charts for a Virtual Machine

You can view capacity and utilization data for virtual machines that are part of a cluster.
Note that daily charts only include full days of data.
If all 24 data points for a day are not available, daily charts are not displayed.
For some capacity and utilization data, CloudForms Management Engine calculates and shows trend lines in the charts which are created using linear regression.
The calculation uses the capacity and utilization data collected by CloudForms Management Engine during the interval you specify.

[NOTE]
======
You must have a server with network visibility to your provider assigned the server role of *Capacity & Utilization Collector* to use this feature.

The virtual machine must be powered on to collect the data.
======

. From menu:Infrastructure[Virtual Machines], click the accordion that you want to view capacity data for.
. Click the item you want to view.
. Click  image:images/1994.png[] (*Monitoring*), and then  image:images/1994.png[] (*Utilization*).
. From *Interval*, select to view *Daily*, *Hourly*, or *Most Recent Hour* data points.
  When choosing *Daily*, you can also select the *Date*, and how far back you want to go from that date.
  When selecting *Hourly*, you can select the date for which you want to view hourly data.
  If you are using *Time Profiles*, you will be able to select that as an option, also.

[NOTE]
======
Daily charts only include full days of data.
This means CloudForms Management Engine does not show daily data for a day without a complete 24 data point range for a day.
