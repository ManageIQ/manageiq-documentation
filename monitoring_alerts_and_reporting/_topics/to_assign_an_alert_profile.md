### Assigning an Alert Profile

After an alert profile is created and verified, you can assign it
directly to a resource.

1.  Navigate to menu:Control\[Explorer\].

2.  Click on the **Alert Profiles** accordion, then click on the alert
    profile that you want to assign.

3.  Click ![1847](../images/1847.png) (**Configuration**),
    ![1851](../images/1851.png) (**Edit Assignments for this Alert
    Profile**).

4.  The options presented change based on if the alert is for a cluster,
    datastore, {{ site.data.product.title }} server, host, or virtual machine and
    instance. You can assign to the enterprise, to specific hosts,
    cluster, resource pools, and providers, or based on assign tags. For
    a {{ site.data.product.title }} server alert profile, you can only assign to
    {{ site.data.product.title }} servers in the current Region.

5.  Click **Save**.
