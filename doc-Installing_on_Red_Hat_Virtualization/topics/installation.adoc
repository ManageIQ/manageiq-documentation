=== Uploading the Appliance on Red Hat Virtualization Manager

The method for uploading the {product-title_short} appliance differs depending on the Red Hat Virtualization version you are using.

In Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 and newer, upload the `QCOW2` appliance image using the Red Hat Virtualization Administration Portal.

In Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.6 and earlier, upload the `OVA` appliance image using the image uploader tool. You can also use this method for Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 systems.

Uploading the {product-title} appliance file to Red Hat Virtualization requires:

* 44 GB of storage space on both the export domain and the local partition where `/tmp` resides, as the `OVF` archive is locally expanded into that directory.
* 12 GB RAM.
* 4 vCPUs.


[[uploading-the-appliance-using-the-admin-portal]]
==== Uploading the Appliance Using the Administration Portal

In Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 and newer, upload the `QCOW2` appliance image using the Red Hat Virtualization Administration Portal.
After uploading the image, create a disk and attach it to a virtual machine.

.Prerequisites:

* You must configure the Image I/O Proxy when running `engine-setup`. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-virtualization/4.1/paged/installation-guide/33-configuring-the-red-hat-virtualization-manager[Configuring the Red Hat Virtualization Manager] in the  _Red Hat Virtualization Installation Guide_ for more information.
* Internet Explorer 10, Firefox 35, or Chrome 13 or greater is required to perform this upload procedure. Previous browser versions do not support the required HTML5 APIs.
* You must import the required certificate authority into the web browser used to access the Administration Portal.

[NOTE]
====
To import the certificate authority, browse to `https://<engine_address>/ovirt-engine/services/pki-resource?resource=ca-certificate&format=X509-PEM-CA` and select all the trust settings. Refer to the instructions to install the certificate authority in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/95103[Firefox], https://access.redhat.com/solutions/17864[Internet Explorer], or https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1168383[Google Chrome].
====

To upload the appliance:

. Open the *Upload Image* screen in the Administration Portal:
* From the *Disks* tab, select *Start* from the *Upload* drop-down.
* Alternatively, from the *Storage* tab select the storage domain, then select the *Disks* sub-tab, and select *Start* from the *Upload* drop-down.
. In the *Upload Image* screen, click *Browse* and select the image on the local disk.
. Set *Image Type* to *QCOW2*.
. Fill in the *Disk Option* fields. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.1-beta/html-single/administration_guide/#Add_Virtual_Disk_dialogue_entries[Explanation of Settings in the New Virtual Disk Window] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Administration Guide_ for a description of the relevant fields.
. Click *OK*.

A progress bar will indicate the status of the upload. You can also pause, cancel, or resume uploads from the *Upload* drop-down.

See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.1-beta/html-single/administration_guide/#Uploading_a_Disk_Image_to_a_Storage_Domain[Uploading a Disk Image to a Storage Domain] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Administration Guide_ for more information.


[[uploading-the-appliance-with-the-image-uploader]]
==== Uploading the Appliance with the Image Uploader

In Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.6 and earlier, upload the appliance as an `OVA` image using the image uploader tool. Red Hat Virtualization 4.0 supports this method as well.

Refer to
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.1-beta/html-single/administration_guide/#sect-The_Image_Uploader_Tool[The Image Uploader Tool] in the _Red Hat Virtualization Administration Guide_ for more details on using the image uploader.

To install the image uploader, install the `rhevm-image-uploader` package containing the `engine-image-uploader` script to your local machine:

----
# yum install rhevm-image-uploader
----


Upload the {product-title} appliance using the image uploader:

. Change to the directory containing the {product-title} appliance.
. Run the following command:
+
----
# engine-image-uploader -N `newimagename` -e `myexportdomain` -v -m upload cfme-rhevm-5.3-15.x86_64.rhevm.ova
----
+
Substitute `newimagename` with your chosen name for the image, and substitute `myexportdomain` with your chosen export storage domain.
+
====
[NOTE]
It is recommended to use `-v` (verbose logging) when using the `engine-image-uploader` script to see the progression of the upload.
====
+
. Enter the password of the default administrative user for your Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager when prompted.
+
----
Please provide the REST API password for the admin@internal oVirt Engine user (CTRL+D to abort): **********
----
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure your Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager has administrator access to the chosen export storage domain.
====

It takes approximately 90 minutes to upload the {product-title} appliance file to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. Once the `OVA` is uploaded and imported as a template, add a network adapter to the template itself.


[[uploading-the-appliance-manually]]
==== Uploading the Appliance Manually

The following procedure provides manual upload instructions if the image uploader tool is not available or fails to upload.

. Log into a host in your Red Hat Virtualization system with a mount to the export storage domain.
. Change to the export storage domain's directory.
. Copy the {product-title} appliance `OVF` archive to this directory.
. Run the `ls` command to locate the directory named after a GUID, and change to that directory.
. Extract the `OVF` file using the `tar` command, substituting the `.ova` filename with your download. For example:
+
----
[root@localhost 4a8fc2b1-0a57-47fd-b622-7e170981305b]# tar xvf ../cfme-rhevm-5.9.0.17-1.x86_64.rhevm.ova

----
+
. Change ownership of the `images` and `master` export directories so the appliance can be imported as a template:
+
----
[root@localhost 4a8fc2b1-0a57-47fd-b622-7e170981305b]# chown -R 36:36 master/
[root@localhost 4a8fc2b1-0a57-47fd-b622-7e170981305b]# chown -R 36:36 images/
----
+
