{product-title}' integration with AWS CloudFormation and OpenStack Heat provides an ability to:

* Inventory all +AWS CloudFormation+ and +OpenStack Heat+ stacks and elements into +{product-title}'s VMDB+.
* Model the relationships of instances to their stacks, inclusive of the UI. Example, selecting an instance within a region that is within a stack, the UI shows this on the standard instance view.
* Model the stack and its elements in the UI.

=======
When importing a template into {product-title}, the selected elements are converted according to their type. For example, lists convert to list boxes, and single items convert to text boxes.
