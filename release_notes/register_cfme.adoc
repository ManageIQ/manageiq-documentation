== Registering and Updating {product-title}

The *Red Hat Updates* page, accessible from menu:Configure[Configuration > Region], enables you to edit customer information, register appliances, and update appliances. Editing customer information enables you to determine
the registration point, User ID, and password.
{product-title} prompts you to update the Server URL when updating the registration point to a local Red Hat Satellite. The *Status of Available Servers* area provides options to refresh, register, check for updates,
and to update. The *Red Hat Updates* page enables the Content Delivery Network (CDN) to assign the necessary update packages to the {product-title} Server.

Using the *Check For Updates* task button, the CDN assigns any necessary update packages to your server and notifies you. Click *Update*, and the {product-title} packages install and update.

Three steps are required to update the {product-title} Appliance:

. Register the {product-title} for updates if it is not already registered.
. Update the {product-title} Appliance.
. Update other system packages.

The following tools are used during the update process:

* `yum` provides package installation, updates, and dependency checking.
* Red Hat Subscription Manager manages subscriptions and entitlements.
* Red Hat Satellite Server runs at customer locations providing local system registration and updates from inside the customer's firewall.

[IMPORTANT]
======
The update worker synchronizes the VMDB with the status of available {product-title} content every 12 hours.
======

[NOTE]
======
Servers with the *RHN Mirror* role also act as a repository for other Appliances to pull {product-title} packages updates.

[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Option|Use
|Check for Updates| Checks for available updates using yum.
|Register|Attempts to register the appliance if it is not already registered. {product-title} subscribes to the `rhel-x86_64-server-6-cf-me-4` RHN channel for RHN registered appliances, and to the products designated by Red Hat product certification for subscription-manager registered appliances. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux channels are enabled by default on registration. In addition, {product-title} checks for updates after registering.
|Apply {product-title} Update|Applies updates to {product-title} packages only. Specifically, this option runs the `yum -y update cfme-appliance` command. This command installs every package listed in the dependency tree if it is not already installed. If a specific version of a package is required, that version of the package is installed or upgraded. No other packages, such as PostgreSQL or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, are updated.
|=======================================================================

=== Updating the Appliance Operating System

Users update {product-title} packages through the web console under menu:Configure[Configuration > Settings > Region > Red Hat Updates]. However, updating the Appliance's operating system requires a manual update using the `yum` command.

. Log in to the Appliance as the root user.
. Run the `yum update` command and confirm any updates.
