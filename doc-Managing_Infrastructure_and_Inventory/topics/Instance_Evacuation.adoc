If a Compute node is shut down, you can _evacuate_ instances hosted on it. This is only useful if the instances use shared storage or block storage volumes. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-openstack-platform/8/single/instances-and-images-guide/#section-migration-evacuation[Evacuate Instances] in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform _Instances and Images Guide_ for details on the underlying OpenStack process.

To evacuate an instance:

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Clouds > Instances].

. On the right pane, click the instance to be evacuated. Use the *Instances by Provider* accordion to filter instances by provider and/or availability zone.

. Click image:2007.png[](*Lifecycle*), then image:2097.png[](*Evacuate selected Instance*).

. On the *Evacuate Host* section, select your preferred evacuation options:
** *Auto-select Host?*: let the OpenStack provider automatically choose a destination Compute node. If you prefer to choose a specific node, uncheck this option and choose from the *Destination Host* dropdown.
** *On Shared Storage*: leave this checked to indicate that all instance files are on shared storage.

. Click *Submit*.

Once the evacuation initiates, the instance list will reload with a message indicating that the selected instance is being evacuated. Upon completion, the instance list will reload and the evacuated instance will be displayed as image:2143.png[] (*On*).
