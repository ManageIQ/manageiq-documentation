Create a service catalog item from an Ansible Tower template you can use to execute an Ansible Tower playbook in {product-title}. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must first create the job template in Ansible Tower. The job templates are automatically discovered by {product-title_short} when refreshing your Ansible Tower providerâ€™s inventory.

First, create a catalog:

. Navigate to menu:Services[Catalogs].
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then  image:1862.png[Add a New Catalog] (*Add a New Catalog*)
. Enter a *Name* and *Description* for the catalog.
. Click *Add*.

Then, create an Ansible Tower service catalog item:

. Navigate to menu:Automation[Ansible Tower > Jobs].
. Click *Ansible Tower Job Templates* and select an Ansible Tower job template.
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then  image:1862.png[Create Service Dialog from this Job Template] (*Create Service Dialog from this Job Template*).
. Enter a *Service Dialog Name* (for example, _ansible_tower_job_)and click *Save*.
. Navigate to menu:Services[Catalogs]. Click *Catalog Items*.
.  Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then  image:1862.png[Add a New Catalog Item] (*Add a New Catalog Item*) to create a new catalog item with the following details, at minimum:
- For *Catalog Item type*, select *Ansible Tower*.
- Enter a *Name* for the service catalog item.
- Select *Display in Catalog*.
- In *Catalog*, select the catalog you created previously.
- In *Dialog*, select the service dialog you created previously (in this example, _ansible_tower_job_). *No Dialog* can be selected if the playbook does not require extra variables from the user. To ask the user to enter extra information when running the task, *Service Dialog* must be selected. 
- In *Provider*, select your Ansible Tower provider. This brings up the *Ansible Tower Job Template* option and configures the *Provisioning Entry Point State Machine* automatically.
- Add configuration information for *Reconfigure Entry Point* and *Retirement Entry Point* as applicable. 
- Select your desired *Ansible Tower Job Template* from the list. Generally, this is the Ansible Tower job template previously used to create the service dialog.


. Click *Add*. The catalog item you created will appear in the *All Service Catalog Items* list.
