=== REST API Authorization

When authenticating to the appliance, the current group of the authenticated user will be used for
determining the authorization of what the user can see and do using the REST API. While this
is acceptable when users only belong to a single group, this falls short when users are authenticating
using their External Authentication credentials (IPA, LDAP or AD) where they may belong to
multiple groups.

==== Specifying Authorization Group

This section describes how to specify an authorization group for the user.
The mechanism described here is honored for both methods of authentication:

* Basic Authentication
* Token based Authentication

The user's group is to be specified in the new HTTP Header:

[source,data]
----
X-MIQ-Group
----

and is to contain the user's group name.

Example request using Basic Authentication:

[source,sh]
----
$ curl --user username:password
        -i -X GET -H "Accept: application/json"
        -H "X-MIQ-Group: auditors"
        http://localhost:3000/api/vms
----

Example request using Token based Authentication:

[source,sh]
----
$ curl -i -X GET -H "Accept: application/json"
       -H "X-Auth-Token: 93d98fd44cc5a401ff385ba87b21fd13"
       -H "X-MIQ-Group: auditors"
       http://localhost:3000/api/vms
----

The validated users's group will be in effect for the duration of the REST API request.
Multiple requests can be made as a particular user but with different authorization groups
concurrently.

==== Specifying an Invalid Authorization Group

In case an invalid authorization group is specified, a 401 Unauthorized is returned:

[source,data]
----
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
...

{
  "error" : {
    "kind" : "unauthorized",
    "message" : "Invalid Authorization Group <invalid_group_name> specified",
    "klass" : "ApiController::AuthenticationError"
  }
}
