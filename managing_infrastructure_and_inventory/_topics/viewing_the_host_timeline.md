# Viewing the Host Timeline

View the timeline of events for the virtual machines registered to a
host.

1.  Browse to menu: **Compute > Infrastructure > Hosts**.

2.  Click the host to view the timeline.

3.  Click ![1994](../images/1994.png) (**Monitoring**), and then
    ![1995](../images/1995.png) (**Timelines**) or from the host
    accordion, click menu: **Properties > Timelines**.

4.  From **Options**, customize the period of time to display and the
    types of events to see.

      - Use **Show** to select types of events to show on the timeline.

      - Use the **Interval** dropdown to select hourly or daily data
        points.

      - Use **Date** to type the date the timeline displays.

      - If you select to view a daily timeline, use **Show** to set how
        many days back to go. The maximum history is 31 days. If
        selecting **Hourly**, select the interval to see.

      - From the **Level** dropdown, select either a **Summary** event
        or a **Detail** list of events. For example, the detail level of
        a **Power On** event might include the power on request, the
        starting event, and the actual **Power On** event. If you select
        **Summary**, only the Power On event appears in the timeline.

      - The three **Event Group** dropdowns allow selection of different
        groups of events to display. Each group has its own color.

5.  To see more detail on an item in the timeline, click on it. A
    balloon appears with a clickable link to the resource.
