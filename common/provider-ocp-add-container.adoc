. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Providers].
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then click  image:1862.png[Add a New Containers Provider] (*Add Existing Containers Provider*).
. Enter a *Name* for the provider.
. From the *Type* list, select *OpenShift Container Platform*.
. Enter the appropriate *Zone* for the provider. If you do not specify a zone, it is set to `default`.
. Under *Endpoints* in the *Default* tab, configure the following for the OpenShift provider: 
.. Select a *Security Protocol* method to specify how to authenticate the provider:
* *SSL*: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required for this option.
* *SSL trusting custom CA*: Authenticate the provider with a self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your provider’s CA certificate to the *Trusted CA Certificates* box in PEM format.
+
[NOTE]
====
To obtain your OpenShift Container Platform provider's CA certificate, run the `oc get secret` command on your provider, substituting values for your provider and token as needed. To obtain a token for your provider, see xref:Obtaining_OpenShift_Container_Platform_Management_Token[].

For example:

  # oc get secret --namespace management-infra management-admin-token-8ixxs --template='{{index .data "ca.crt"}}' | base64 --decode
  
Paste the output (a block of text starting with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`) into the *Trusted CA Certificates* field.
====
+
* *SSL without validation*: Authenticate the provider insecurely (not recommended).
.. Enter the *Hostname* or IPv4 or IPv6 address of the provider.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The *Hostname* must use a unique fully qualified domain name.
====
+
.. Enter the *API Port* of the provider.
  The default port is `8443`.
.. Enter the OpenShift management token in the *Token* field. This is the token obtained earlier in xref:Obtaining_OpenShift_Container_Platform_Management_Token[].
.. Enter the same token in the *Confirm Token* field.
.. Click *Validate* to confirm that {product-title} can connect to the OpenShift Container Platform provider.
. Under *Endpoints* in the *Hawkular* tab, configure the following for Hawkular capacity and utilization metrics collection:
.. Select a *Security Protocol* method to specify how to authenticate the provider:
* *SSL*: Authenticate the provider securely using a trusted Certificate Authority. Select this option if the provider has a valid SSL certificate and it is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. No further configuration is required for this option.
* *SSL trusting custom CA*: Authenticate the provider with a self-signed certificate. For this option, copy your provider’s CA certificate to the *Trusted CA Certificates* box in PEM format.

[NOTE]
====
In OpenShift, the default deployment of the router generates certificates during installation, which can be used with the *SSL trusting custom CA* option. Connecting a Hawkular endpoint with this option requires the CA certificate that the cluster uses for service certificates, which is stored in `/etc/origin/master/service-signer.crt` on the first master in a cluster. You can also obtain the certificate from the cluster by running the following on your provider:

  # oc get secrets $(oc get secrets -n default -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.type=="kubernetes.io/service-account-token")].metadata.name}{"\n"}' | grep  -Eo "router.+" | awk '{print $1}') -n default -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}{"\n"}' | base64 -d
====
+
* *SSL without validation*: Authenticate the provider insecurely using SSL. (Not recommended)
.. Enter the *Hostname* or IPv4 or IPv6 address of the provider.
.. Enter the *API Port* if your Hawkular provider uses a non-standard port for access. The default port is `443`.
.. Click *Validate* to confirm that {product-title} can connect to the Hawkular endpoint.
. Click *Add*.
