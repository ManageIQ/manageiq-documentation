=== Configuring the Firewall

A new appliance starts with a few standard ports open:

* 22 for SSH communication
* 80 for HTTP access to the appliance
* 443 for HTTPS access to the appliance
* 5432 for the appliance database

You might need to restrict or open access to certain services on your appliance in the future.
In such situations, use the following method:

* Use `firewalld` to enable a service or port.
  For example, to open the LDAP port:
+
------
[root@ ~]# firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=389/tcp
------

The following table lists the appliance's main services and their respective ports.
