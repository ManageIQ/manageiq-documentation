=== Changing Priority Order of Domains

Functions are executed depending on the order of Domain priority. Use
this procedure to change the priority order of domains.

Navigate to AutomateExplorer. The default view is the Datastore.

Select the Domains you want to change the priority order for.

Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (Configuration), then
image:../images/1851.png[image] (Edit Priority Order of Domains).

The list of Domains selected shows up. Note that you cannot change the
priority of locked Domains and therefore locked Domains do not show up
on the list.

Select one or more consecutive groups to move up or down to change their
priority as required.

Click Save.
