Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > _Object_] to view information on many different container objects. 

[[cross-providers-insight]]
== Cross-Providers Insight

Cross-providers insight is a feature that connects all layers of infrastructure, cloud, and containers known to {product-title} and collects data for analysis.

It supports cross-linking all of the layers available in the following environments:

* OpenStack
* Red Hat Virtualization
* VMware vCenter
* Amazon EC2
* Google Cloud Engine

The collected information includes all the data available in other (infrastructure or cloud) providers.

[NOTE]
====
For Amazon EC2 (AWS) and Google Cloud Engine (GCE) support, OpenShift must be installed using the relevant cloud provider. For more information, see the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/openshift-container-platform/[OpenShift Container Platform Installation and Configuration Guide], ensuring you use the desired version of OpenShift.

[[working-with-the-containers-overview-page]]
== Working with the Containers Overview Page

The information on all containers providers and entities known to {product-title} is summarized on the Containers *Overview* page. The *Overview* page provides links to other summary pages which contain further information on the containers providers and entities.
The *Overview* page also provides metrics for *Aggregated Node Utilization*, *Network Utilization Trend*, *New Image Usage Trend*, *Node Utilization*, and *Pod Creation and Deletion Trends*.

.Working with the Containers Overview Page
. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Overview].
. Click the desired containers entity, or provider, if applicable, for viewing the summary with further information.

[NOTE]
====
To reliably associate pods and images, {product-title_short} requires information from the `docker-pullable` field, added in OpenShift 3.3.1.2. This can affect the results of the *Chargeback by Image* report for older OpenShift providers, and potentially cause image inspection (done as part of Smart State Analysis) to fail due to associating a container to the wrong image.
Consequently, {product-title_short} may not report accurate information about pods and images in OpenShift providers before version 3.3.1.2.

[[using-the-topology-widget]]
== Using the Topology Widget

The *Topology* widget is an interactive topology graph, showing the status and relationships between the different entities of the containers providers and projects to which {product-title} has access.

* The topology graph includes pods, containers, services, nodes, virtual machines, hosts, routes, and replicators within the overall containers provider environment.

=== Viewing the Topology for Container Providers
. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Providers].
. Click the desired containers provider for viewing the provider summary.
. On the provider summary page, click *Topology* in the *Overview* box on the right-hand side of the page.

=== Viewing the Topology for Container Provider Projects
The project topology page displays the project as the center node, surrounded by its related entities. 

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Projects].
. Click on a project.
. On the project summary page, click image:topologyviewbutton.png[Topology View button] (*Topology View*) on the top right-hand side of the page. 

=== Limiting the Number of Containers Shown in the Topology View
. Navigate to the settings menu, then *My Settings*, and click on the *Visual* tab.
. Select the number of container items from the drop-down under *Topology Default Items in View*.
. Click *Save*.

[[running-a-smartstate-analysis]]
== Running a SmartState Analysis

Perform a SmartState analysis of a container image to inspect the packages included in an image.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title_short} performs SmartState analysis on container providers by creating an OpenShift pod to run the SmartState process. When using a proxy to connect to outside resources, such as the image repository used by OpenShift, add the proxy credentials to the OpenShift pod as described in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2915411.
====

.Running a SmartState Analysis
. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Container Images].
. Check the container image to analyze. You can check multiple images.
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), and then  image:1942.png[Perform SmartState Analysis] (*Perform SmartState Analysis*).


The container image is scanned. The process will copy over any required files for the image. After reloading the image page, all new or updated packages are listed.

To monitor the status of container image SmartState analysis tasks, navigate to the settings menu, then *Tasks*. The status of each task is displayed including time started, time ended, what part of the task is currently running, and any errors encountered.
