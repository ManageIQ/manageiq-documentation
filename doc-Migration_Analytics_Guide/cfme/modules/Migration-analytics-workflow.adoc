image:circle_1.png[20,20] In the CloudForms user interface, you scan your VMware virtual machines.

image:circle_2.png[20,20] CloudForms collects data about the virtual machine operating systems and workloads.

image:circle_3.png[20,20] CloudForms creates an inventory data file, which you can download to your local machine to view.

image:circle_4.png[20,20] In a browser, you navigate to the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/beta[Migration Analytics service] and create a report. The Migration Analytics service uploads the inventory data file and analyzes it.
