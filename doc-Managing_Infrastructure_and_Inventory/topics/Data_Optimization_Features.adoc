[[data-optimization]]
= Data Optimization

{product-title} optimization functions allow you to view
utilization trends, and identify and project bottlenecks in your
environment. In addition, you can predict where you have capacity for
additional virtual machines, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.5/html-single/deployment_planning_guide/#planning-where-to-put-a-new-virtual-machine[Planning Where to Put a New Virtual Machine] in the _Deployment Planning Guide_.

[NOTE]
====
* To access the utilization and bottleneck report features, you will first need to enable data collection in {product-title}; see the following sections in the _Deployment Planning Guide_:
** link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.5/html/deployment_planning_guide/Capacity_Planning#assigning_the_capacity_and_utilization_server_roles[Assigning the Capacity and Utilization Server Roles]
** link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.5/html/deployment_planning_guide/capacity_planning#data_collected[Capacity and Utilization Data Collected]

* For reporting of daily optimization data, incomplete days (days with less
than 24 hourly data points from midnight to midnight) that are at the
beginning or end of the requested interval are excluded. Days with less
than 24 hourly data points would be inaccurate and including them would
skew trend lines, therefore, the *Optimize* page requires at least two full
days of daily data. All charted values are derived from trend
calculations that requires at least two data points.

[[utilization-trends]]
== Utilization Trends

{product-title} allows you to view the resource utilization of your clusters, providers, and datastores. You can choose from summary,
details, or report view.

[[viewing-utilization-trend-summary]]
=== Viewing a Utilization Trend Summary

This procedure shows you how to view a utilization trend summary.

. Navigate to menu:Optimize[Utilization].
. Click *Summary* if it is not already selected.
. Expand the tree on the left side, until you can see the desired
  providers, clusters, or datastores.
. Click on the item.
. Use the *Options* section in the *Summary* tab to change the
  characteristics of the data.
+
* Use *Trends* to select how far back you want to calculate
  the trend.
* Use *Selected Day* for the date you want to see percent utilization
  for in the chart on the *Summary* tab.
* Use *Classification* to only see trends for a specific applied tag.
* Use *Time Profile* to select an existing time profile. If the
  logged on user does not have any time profiles available, this
  option will not show.
* Select a *Time Zone*.

[[viewing-detail-lines-of-a-utilization-trend]]
=== Viewing Detail Lines of a Utilization Trend

This procedure shows you how to view detail lines of a utilization trend.

. Navigate to menu:Optimize[Utilization].
. Expand the tree on the left side, until you can see the desired
  providers, clusters, or datastores.
. Click on the item.
. Click *Details* if it is not already selected.
. From the *Options* area, select how far back you want to view the
  trends for and any classifications you want to use.

[[viewing-a-report-of-a-utilization-trend]]
=== Viewing a Report of a Utilization Trend

To find out more about resource utilization, view utilization trend
reports.

. Navigate to menu:Optimize[Utilization].
. Expand the tree on the left side, until you can see the desired
  providers, clusters, or datastores.
. Click on the item.
. Click *Report* if it is not already selected.
. From the *Options* area, select how far back you want to view the
  trends for and any classifications you want to use.


[[bottlenecks]]
== Bottlenecks

{product-title} can show where bottlenecks occur in your
virtual infrastructure. You can view them either on a timeline or as a
report which can be downloaded for further analysis. 

[[prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

* Bottleneck reports use the same mechanism to gather data as capacity and utilization reports. To enable data collection in {product-title}, see the following sections:
** link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.5/html/deployment_planning_guide/Capacity_Planning#assigning_the_capacity_and_utilization_server_roles[Assigning the Capacity and Utilization Server Roles]
** link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.5/html/deployment_planning_guide/capacity_planning#data_collected[Capacity and Utilization Data Collected]
* Additionally, configure your {product-title} for collecting capacity and utilization reports for clusters and datastores by following this procedure:
.. From the settings menu, select *Configuration*.
.. Select *Region* from the *Settings* tab in the left pane of the appliance. 
.. In the right pane, under the *C & U Collection* tab, check the boxes for *Collect for All Clusters* under *Clusters* and *Collect for All Datastores* under *Datastores*, or check the boxes for the clusters/datastores you desire.
+
[NOTE]
====
*Collect for All Clusters* must be checked to be able to collect capacity and utilization data from cloud providers such as Red Hat OpenStack or Amazon EC2.
====
+
.. Click *Save*.
* For bottleneck reports to work as expected, the data collection for capacity and utilization reports should also be enabled for the relevant backend provider. See the following documentation to enable data collection for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization and Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform provider:
** For Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization: link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.5/html/deployment_planning_guide/capacity_planning#data_collection_for_rhev_33_34[Data Collection for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization]
** For Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform: link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.5/html/deployment_planning_guide/capacity_planning#data_collection_for_osp[Data Collection for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform]

[NOTE]
====
For reporting of daily bottleneck data, incomplete days
(days with less than 24 hourly data points from midnight to midnight)
that are at the beginning or end of the requested interval are excluded.
Days with less than 24 hourly data points would be inaccurate and
including them would skew trend lines. Therefore, at least one full day
of hourly data from midnight to midnight is necessary for displaying the
bottleneck charts under the *Optimize* tab.
