# Searching for Instances or Images

To the right of the taskbar on the **Instances** page, you can enter names or parts of
names for searching. You can search in the following ways.

- Type characters that are **included** in the name. For example, if you type `sp1`, all Instances whose names include `sp1` appear, such as `Windows2003` and `Sp1clone`.

- Use `*` at the end of a term to search for names that begin with specific characters. For example, type `v*` to find all instances whose names begin with the letter `v`.

- Use `*` at the beginning of a term to search for names that end with specific characters. For example, type `*\sp2` to find all instances whose names end with `sp2`.

- Erase all characters from the search box to go back to viewing all instances.
