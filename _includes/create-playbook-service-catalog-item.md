<div class="note">

  - Before creating an Ansible service, at least one repository, one
    playbook, and one credential must exist in the {{ site.data.product.title }}
    inventory. Check your inventory and add the appropriate resources
    before creating an Ansible service. For more information, see
    [Automation Management
    Providers](https://www.manageiq.org/docs/reference/latest/managing_providers/index.html#automation-management-providers)
    in *Managing Providers*.

  - Debugging verbosity is available for Ansible playbook catalog items.
    Selecting a higher verbosity value provides more detailed output as
    the playbook executes. **0 (Normal)** is the default value. **1
    (Verbose)** will yield return data while a value of **3 (Debug)**
    provides connection attempt and task invocation details. Higher
    levels, such as **4 (Connection)** can be useful for debugging SSH
    connections. Use **5 (WinRM Debug)** when debugging WinRM
    connections.

  - Using Ansible playbooks to populate dynamic dialog fields is not
    recommended due to delay times caused by the overhead of interaction
    between systems.

  - Only users with administrator privileges can run a service dialog
    based on a playbook.
