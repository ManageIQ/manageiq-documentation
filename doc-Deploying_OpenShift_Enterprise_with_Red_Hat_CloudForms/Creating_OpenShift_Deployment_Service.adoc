== Creating an OpenShift Enterprise Deployment Service

Service items do not exist as OpenShift Enterprise nodes, brokers, or servers, as they have not been ordered and instantiated yet by a consumer.
In order for consumers to request these items and provide them with deployment options, the items must be collected in a service bundle.
CloudForms Management Engine presents this bundle to the user, and it can include other items in addition to OpenShift Enterprise.
The following procedure combines the service items created earlier to create a bundle.

. Log in to the CloudForms Management Engine appliance and navigate to +Services → Catalogs+.
. Select the +Catalogs+ accordion.
. Click +Configuration → Add a New Catalog+.

CloudForms Management Engine creates the bundle and makes it available to consumers in their service catalog. Tag the service as required to control its visibility to different roles.
