		Data collection begins immediately. However, the first collection begins 5 minutes after the server is started, and every 10 minutes after that. Therefore, the longest the collection takes after enabling the capacity &amp; utilization collector server role is 10 minutes. The first collection from a particular provider may take a few minutes since <productname>CloudForms Management Engine</productname> is gathering data points going one month back in time.
