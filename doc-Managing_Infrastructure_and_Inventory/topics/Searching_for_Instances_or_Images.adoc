= Searching for Instances or Images

To the right of the taskbar on the *Instances* page, you can enter names or parts of names for searching.
You can search in the following ways.

* Type characters that are *included* in the name.
  For example, if you type `sp1`, all Instances whose names include `sp1` appear, such as `Windows2003` and `Sp1clone`.
* Use `\*` at the end of a term to search for names that *begin* with specific characters.
  For example, type `v*` to find all instances whose names begin with the letter `v`.
* Use `\*` at the beginning of a term to search for names that *end* with specific characters.
  For example, type `*sp2` to find all instances whose names end with `sp2`.
* Erase all characters from the search box to go back to viewing all instances.
