# Viewing a Flavor

You can click on a specific flavor to view its details. The screen
provides you with a flavor accordion and a flavor summary.

  - Use flavor summary views to change how you are looking at the
    summary.

  - Use the flavor accordion to view the **Properties** of the flavor
    and its **Relationships**.

  - Use the flavor summary to see details on **Properties** (**CPUs**,
    **CPU Cores**, **Memory**), **Relationships** (**Cloud Provider**,
    **Instances**), and **Smart Management** (**Company Tags**).
