### Setting the Password for the Administrative User

{{ site.data.product.title_short }} uses a unique `admin` user to control all functions in
the web-based user interface. After installing the appliance, change the
default password of the `admin` to restrict administrative access to the
appliance’s UI.

Changing the `admin` password uses the same process as changing any
standard user in the appliance.

1.  Access the appliance through your web browser and log in.

2.  Click ![config gear](../images/config-gear.png) (**Configuration**).

3.  In the accordion tree on the left, click on **Access Control**, then
    select the **Administrator** under the **Users** section. This
    displays the details for the `admin` user.

4.  On the details page, select **Configuration > Edit this user**
    from the toolbar.

5.  Enter a new password in the **Change Password / Confirm Password**
    fields.

6.  Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

7.  Log out of the user interface.

8.  Test your new password by logging into the user interface.
    Additionally, test your new password in the appliance console.

The {{ site.data.product.title_short }} appliance now has a non-default `admin` password.
This restricts access to your appliance’s administrative functions.
