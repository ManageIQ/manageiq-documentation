### Creating a Normal Operating Range Alert

Normal operating range alerts enables you to be notified when the normal
operating range is exceeded, or falls below for a period of time from 1
minute to 2 hours. Capacity and utilization must be enabled for normal
operating ranges to be calculated. See *General Configuration* for more
information.
