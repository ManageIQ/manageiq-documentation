==== Assigning an Action to an Event

This procedure describes how to assign an action to an event.

. Navigate to menu:Control[Explorer].

. Click the *Policies* accordion, and select the policy you want to assign actions to.

. From the *Events* area, click on the description of the event you want to assign an action to.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (*Configuration*), image:../images/1851.png[image] (*Edit Actions for this Policy Event*).

[NOTE]
====
Each selected action can be executed synchronously or asynchronously; synchronous actions will not start until the previous synchronous action is completed, and asynchronous action allows the next action to start whether or not the first action has completed. Also, at least one
{product-title} server in the {product-title} zone must have the notifier server role enabled for the trap to be sent.
