		When you create a user group, you must specify a role to give the group rights to resources in the console, and then assign a user to a group. <productname>CloudForms Management Engine</productname> provides a default group of roles, but you can also create your own as well as copy the default groups. The table below shows the function available to each group.

			If you have enabled <guilabel>Get Role from LDAP</guilabel> under LDAP Settings, then the role is determined by the LDAP users group membership in the directory service. See <xref linkend="LDAP_Settings" />
