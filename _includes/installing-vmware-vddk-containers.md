### Installing VMware VDDK on containers

Execution of SmartState Analysis on virtual machines within a VMware environment requires the Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) to be installed.

To install the VDDK on containers we can take an existing container and create another layer on top of it.  Once built, this image will need to be pushed to a registry and the CR updated to reflect that.

1. Download the required VDDK version (`VMware-vix-disklib-[version].x86_64.tar.gz`) from the VMware website.

    **Note:**

    - If you do not already have a login ID to VMware, then you will
      need to create one. At the time of this writing, the file can be
      found by navigating to **Downloads > vSphere**. Select the
      version from the drop-down list, then click the **Drivers &
      Tools** tab. Expand **Automation Tools and SDKs**, and click
      **Go to Downloads** next to the **VMware vSphere Virtual Disk
      Development Kit** version. Alternatively, find the file by
      searching for it using the **Search** on the VMware site.

    - See VMware documentation for information about their policy
      concerning backward and forward compatibility for VDDK.

2. Set up a temporary directory where we will build the image

   ```bash
   $ mkdir -p /tmp/vddk_container/container-assets
   ```

3. Copy the tar file into the container-assets directory.  For example,

   ```bash
   $ cp ~/Downloads/VMware-vix-disklib-*.tar.gz /tmp/vddk_container/container-assets
   ```

4. Add the following Dockerfile as `/tmp/vddk_container/Dockerfile` and substitute the second `FROM` based on the image and version that you're running.

   ```dockerfile
   FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi as vddk

   COPY container-assets/ /vddk/

   RUN cd /vddk && \
       filename=$(find . -name VMware-*) && \
       if [[ -f $filename ]] ; then tar -zxvf VMware-* ; fi && \
       mkdir -p vmware-vix-disklib-distrib && \
       touch /vddk/vmware-vix-disklib-distrib/.keep

   ### IMPORTANT: Modify the following image and tag as necessary to reflect the version that you're running
   FROM your_registry.example.com/namespace/manageiq-base-worker:latest

   COPY --from=vddk /vddk/vmware-vix-disklib-distrib/ /usr/lib/vmware-vix-disklib/

   RUN /tmp/install-vmware-vddk
   ```

5. Build the image and tag it appropriately for your registry, then push it to the registry.

   ```bash
   $ cd /tmp/vddk_container/
   $ docker build . -t your_registry.example.com/namespace/manageiq-base-worker:latest_vddk
   $ docker push your_registry.example.com/namespace/manageiq-base-worker:latest_vddk
   ```

6. Update the CR to use the base worker image you just pushed to the registry.

   ```yaml
   baseWorkerImage: your_registry.example.com/namespace/manageiq-base-worker:latest_vddk
   ```

The operator will now update the orchestrator and worker deployments to reflect this change.
