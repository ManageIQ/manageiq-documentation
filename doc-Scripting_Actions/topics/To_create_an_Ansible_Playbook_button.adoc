=== Creating an Ansible Playbook Button

{product-title} includes an option to create an Ansible Playbook custom button. This feature allows users to select a playbook to run as well as an inventory target to run it against. An Ansible playbook type button can be defined for any object type available.
[NOTE]
====
An Ansible Playbook catalog item must exist in order to create an Ansible Playbook custom button. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.5/html/provisioning_virtual_machines_and_hosts/catalogs-services#create-playbook-service-catalog-item[Creating an Ansible Playbook Service Catalog Item] in the Provisioning Virtual Machines and Hosts guide.

If image:../images/1862.png[image] (*Add a new Button*) is not available, that means you have not created a button group for that object. To continue, create a button group first. See <<create-custom-button-group>>.
