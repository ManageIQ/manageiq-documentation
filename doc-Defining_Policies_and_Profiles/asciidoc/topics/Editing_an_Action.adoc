=== Editing an Action

Edit an action to modify its properties. You cannot edit any of the
default actions supplied with CloudForms Management Engine. Only actions
that you create can be changed.

Note that when you view an action, you can see what policies it has been
assigned to.

. Navigate to `Control` -> `Explorer`.

. Click the `Actions` accordion, then click on the action you need to edit.

. Click image:../images/1847.png[image] (`Configuration`),
image:../images/1851.png[image] (`Edit this Action`) on the detail view of
the action.

. Make any required changes.

. Click `Save`.

_Result:_. +
The action is modified and can be added to a policy. If the action is
already party of a policy, the policy is automatically updated.
