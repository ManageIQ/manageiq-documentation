* A VMware virtual machine cannot be migrated if it has any of the following conditions:

** Mounted ISO/CDROM disk
** Encrypted disk
** Invalid name, containing spaces or special characters
ifdef::osp[]

[id="rhv_environment_errors"]
.Red Hat Virtualization

* Name conflict: VMware virtual machine has the same name as a Red Hat Virtualization virtual machine.
* MAC address conflict: VMware virtual machine has the same MAC address as a Red Hat Virtualization virtual machine in a MAC address pool.

* SSH transformation only:

** If you are using SSSD with single sign-on, you must reinstall `ipa-client` without OpenSSH.
** Check that the conversion host does not have an existing private SSH key in `/var/lib/vdsm/.ssh/id_rsa`. Conversion host configuration does not overwrite old SSH keys. They must be deleted manually.
** Check that you enabled SSH access on the VMware hypervisors and correctly configured your conversion hosts for SSH transformation.
