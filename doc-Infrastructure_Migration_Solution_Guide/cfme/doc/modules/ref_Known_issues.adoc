The following issues will be addressed in a future release:

* Canceling a migration does not stop the creation of volumes, instances, and network ports (OpenStack Platform), or virtual machines (Red Hat Virtualization). link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1666799[]

* Virtual machines whose names contain international characters or spaces fail to migrate using SSH transformation. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1669240[]

* Virtual machines whose names contain international characters or spaces fail to migrate using VDDK transformation. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1669286[]

* Red Hat Virtualization:

** Refreshing the hosts causes the network(s) and datastore to disappear from infrastructure mappings. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1669176[]

* OpenStack Platform:

** Instance is not created after disk conversion. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1668049[]
** Names of virtual machines that were migrated using SSH transformation change during migration. link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1669133[]
