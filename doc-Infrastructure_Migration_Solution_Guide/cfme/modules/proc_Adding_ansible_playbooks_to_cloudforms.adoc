= Adding Ansible playbooks to CloudForms for premigration and postmigration tasks

You can add Ansible playbooks to CloudForms to perform automated premigration and postmigration tasks on specific virtual machines, for example:

* Removing webservers from a load-balancing pool before migration and returning them to the pool after migration
* Running `fstrim` after migration to reduce the space required by virtual machines migrating to Red Hat OpenStack Platform with Ceph storage

.Procedure

. Enable the `Embedded Ansible` server role in CloudForms. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html/managing_providers/automation_management_providers#enabling-embedded-ansible-server-role[Enabling the Embedded Ansible Server Role] in _Red Hat CloudForms: Managing Providers_.

. Add an Ansible playbook repository. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html/managing_providers/automation_management_providers#adding-a-playbook-repository[Adding a Playbook Repository] in _Red Hat CloudForms: Managing Providers_.

. Add the credentials of each virtual machine that you are migrating. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html/managing_providers/automation_management_providers#ansible-credentials[Credentials] in _Red Hat CloudForms: Managing Providers_.

. Add your playbook as an Ansible service catalog item. See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.7/html-single/provisioning_virtual_machines_and_instances/#create-playbook-service-catalog-item[Creating an Ansible Playbook Service Catalog Item] in _Red Hat CloudForms: Provisioning Virtual Machines and Instances_.

You will select the playbooks and the virtual machines on which they run in the *Advanced Options* screen when you create the migration plan.
