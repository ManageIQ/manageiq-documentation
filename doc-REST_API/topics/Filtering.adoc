`GET` requests against collections support the following query parameters to enable filtering: 

* `filter[]`: The SQL filter to use for querying the collection.

------
GET /api/resources?filter[]=name='myservice%25'

The query above requests resources that begin with the name `myservice`.
String values must be contained in single or double quotes.
Special characters within the quotes must be URL encoded.
In the example above, the database wildcard character, `%`, is encoded as `%25`.
