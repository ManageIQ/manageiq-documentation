= Discovering Physical Infrastucture Providers

In addition to discovering virtual infrastructure providers, {product-title_short} now has the ability to discover physical infrastructure providers in a given subnet range.

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Physical Infrastructure > Providers].
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), then click image:1942.png[Discover Physical Infrastructure Providers] (*Discover Physical Infrastructure Providers*). 
. Select the provider in *Discovery Type*.
. Enter a *Subnet Range* of IP addresses starting with a *From Address* and ending with a *To Address*.
. Enter a *Port*.
. Click *Start*.

The appliance searches for all physical infrastructure providers in the specified subnet range, and adds them to the user interface. However, before you can manage providers added via discovery feature, you must edit each provider to enter authentication details.
