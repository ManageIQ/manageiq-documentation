== Cloud Orchestration

Cloud Orchestration is a service that allows you to create, update and manage cloud resources and their software components as a single unit and then deploy them in an automated, repeatable way through a template.
Templates use a human-readable syntax and can be defined in text files (thereby allowing users to check them into version control). Templates allow you to easily deploy and re-configure infrastructure for applications within your cloud. A user can author the stack templates, or can upload them from other sources.
