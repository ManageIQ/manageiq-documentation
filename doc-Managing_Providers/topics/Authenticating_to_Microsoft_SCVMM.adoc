= Authenticating to Microsoft SCVMM

Before you can add a Microsoft SCVMM provide to your {product-title} environment, you must enable WinRM to listen for HTTP traffic on Microsoft SCVMM servers. You must also set the appropriate execution policy on the Microsoft SCVMM server to allow PowerShell scripts from the appliance to run remotely. 

. Log in to the Microsoft SCVMM server.
. Enable WinRM for configuration.
+
----
winrm quickconfig
----			
+
. Set the following options:  
+
----
winrm set winrm/config/client/auth @{Basic="true"}
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}
----			
+
. For Windows 2012 R2 with PowerShell 4.0, use the following syntax to set these options:  
+
----
winrm set winrm/config/client/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'
winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'
----			
+
. Enable remote script execution on the SCVMM server using the +Set-ExecutionPolicy+ cmdlet.
+
----
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
----
+
For more information on SCVMM remote script execution policies, see link:http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176961.aspx[Using the Set-ExecutionPolicy Cmdlet]. 

If PowerShell returns an error, search for `log_dos_error_results` in the `evm.log` and `scvmm.log` files for information.
