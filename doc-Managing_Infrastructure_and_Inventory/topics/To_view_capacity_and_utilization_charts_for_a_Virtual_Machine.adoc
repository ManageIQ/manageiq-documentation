= Viewing Capacity and Utilization Charts for a Virtual Machine

You can view capacity and utilization data for virtual machines that are part of a cluster.
Note that daily charts only include full days of data.
If all 24 data points for a day are not available, daily charts are not displayed.
For some capacity and utilization data, {product-title} calculates and shows trend lines in the charts which are created using linear regression.
The calculation uses the capacity and utilization data collected by {product-title} during the interval you specify.

[NOTE]
====
You must have a server with network visibility to your provider assigned the server role of *Capacity & Utilization Collector* to use this feature.

The virtual machine must be powered on to collect the data.
====

. From menu:Compute[Infrastructure > Virtual Machines], click the accordion that you want to view capacity data for.
. Click the item you want to view.
. Click  image:1994.png[] (*Monitoring*), and then  image:1994.png[] (*Utilization*).
. From *Interval*, select to view *Daily*, *Hourly*, or *Most Recent Hour* data points.
  When choosing *Daily*, you can also select the *Date*, and how far back you want to go from that date.
  When selecting *Hourly*, you can select the date for which you want to view hourly data.
  If you are using *Time Profiles*, you will be able to select that as an option, also.

[NOTE]
====
Daily charts only include full days of data.
This means {product-title} does not show daily data for a day without a complete 24 data point range for a day.
