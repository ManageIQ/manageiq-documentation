= Container Entities

This chapter provides information on managing resources on your containers providers.

== The Containers Overview Page

The containers overview page shows information on all containers providers and entities known to {product-title_short}. The *Overview* page provides links to other summary pages which contain further information on the containers providers and entities.
The *Overview* page also provides metrics for *Aggregated Node Utilization*, *Network Utilization Trend*, *New Image Usage Trend*, *Node Utilization*, and *Pod Creation and Deletion Trends*.

.Working with the Containers Overview Page
. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Overview].
. Click the desired containers entity, or provider, if applicable, for viewing the summary with further information.

[NOTE]
====
To reliably associate pods and images, {product-title_short} requires information from the `docker-pullable` field, added in OpenShift 3.3.1.2. This can affect the results of the *Chargeback by Image* report for older OpenShift providers, and potentially cause image inspection (done as part of Smart State Analysis) to fail due to associating a container to the wrong image.
Consequently, {product-title_short} may not report accurate information about pods and images in OpenShift providers before version 3.3.1.2.

[[using-the-topology-widget]]
== Using the Topology Widget

The *Topology* widget is an interactive topology graph, showing the status and relationships between the different entities of the containers providers and projects to which {product-title} has access.

* The topology graph includes pods, containers, services, nodes, virtual machines, hosts, routes, and replicators within the overall containers provider environment.
include::common/topology_widget.adoc[]

=== Viewing the Topology for Container Providers
. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Providers].
. Click the desired containers provider for viewing the provider summary.
. On the provider summary page, click *Topology* in the *Overview* box on the right side of the page.

=== Viewing the Topology for Container Provider Projects
The project topology page displays the project as the center node, surrounded by its related entities. 

. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Projects].
. Click on a project.
. On the project summary page, click image:topologyviewbutton.png[Topology View button] (*Topology View*) on the top right side of the page. 

=== Limiting the Number of Containers Shown in the Topology View
. Navigate to the settings menu, then *My Settings*, and click on the *Visual* tab.
. Select the number of container items from the drop-down under *Topology Default Items in View*.
. Click *Save*.

[[running-a-smartstate-analysis]]
== Analyzing Container Images with SmartState Analysis

Perform a SmartState Analysis of a container image to inspect the packages included in an image.

.Running a SmartState Analysis
. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Container Images].
. Check the container image to analyze. You can check multiple images.
. Click  image:1847.png[Configuration] (*Configuration*), and then  image:1942.png[Perform SmartState Analysis] (*Perform SmartState Analysis*).

The container image is scanned. The process will copy over any required files for the image. After reloading the image page, all new or updated packages are listed.

To monitor the status of container image SmartState Analysis tasks, navigate to the settings menu, then *Tasks*. The status of each task is displayed including time started, time ended, what part of the task is currently running, and any errors encountered.

== Configuring Automatic Tagging for Container Entities

Container object labels in OpenShift can be used to automatically create tags and tag categories in {product-title}. This is done by mapping {product-title} tags to existing OpenShift or Kubernetes labels.

Labels from OpenShift can be mapped to {product-title} tags for the following container entities:

* Projects
* Nodes
* Routes
* Replicators
* Container services
* Pods
* Container builds

[NOTE]
====
Tags automatically created from OpenShift labels are completely managed by the {product-title} system and cannot be manually assigned or unassigned. Deleting a mapping rule from {product-title} immediately deletes the resulting tags.
====

You can view a container entity's OpenShift labels on the entity's details page under *Labels*. 

The following example shows how to configure tagging for a node, but the same steps can be used for mapping labels to tags on other container entities.

To configure automatic tagging on container entities using labels:

. Note the _key_ of the OpenShift label you want to map to a {product-title} tag. OpenShift labels consist of two parts: a _key_ and a _value_.
.. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Nodes].
.. Select a node to open its summary page.
.. Under *Labels*, note the label(s) to map to {product-title} tag(s). Any OpenShift labels will list the _key_ in the left column of the *Labels* table, and the _value_ in the right column of the *Labels* table.
+
This node has six labels (key/value pairs) that were created in OpenShift and collected in the {product-title} inventory:

+
[NOTE]
====
To create an OpenShift label, see https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html[Developer CLI Operations] in the OpenShift Container Platform _CLI Reference_ guide. A new label added in OpenShift will only show up in {product-title} after the next OpenShift provider refresh.
====
+
. Navigate to *Configuration* and select the region.
. Click the *Map Tags* tab.
. Click *Add* to create a new mapping rule.
.. Select a container entity to tag from the *Entity* list, or select *<All>* to tag all entities.
.. Specify the _key_ from the OpenShift label you noted earlier in the *Label* field. 
.. Specify a {product-title} tag category in *Category* to map the label to. If the tag category does not exist yet in {product-title}, it will be created automatically.
+
image:Add_label_mapping.png[]
+
.. Click *Add*.
The mapping will show in the table on the *Map Tags* tab.
+
. Refresh the provider to complete the mapping:
.. Navigate to menu:Compute[Containers > Providers].
.. Select the provider to refresh.
.. Click  image:1847.png[] (*Configuration*), and then  image:2003.png[] (*Refresh Items and Relationships*).

The label will display on the entity's summary page under *Smart Management* under *Company Tags* as `<Category> : <value>`.

image:OCP-autotagged.png[]

Any container entity with the OpenShift `zone` label will be tagged automatically as `category1` in {product-title}. If the _value_ for `zone` is `south`, for example, the entity will be tagged as `category1 : south`.

You can use these tags to create reports. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-cloudforms/4.7-Beta/single/monitoring-alerts-and-reporting/[Monitoring, Alerts, and Reporting] for details on creating reports.
