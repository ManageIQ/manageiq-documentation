= Accessing and Using a Timeline

You can use timelines to view the history record for virtual machines.

[NOTE]
======
Amazon does not provide events, so {product-title} does not support timelines for virtual machines hosted by Amazon.
======

. Navigate to menu:Cloud Intelligence[Timelines].
. From the accordion on the left, click a category of *Timeline*.
+
* Select *Configuration Management* to see when items were brought under management.
* Select *Events* to view timelines related to operations and changes in configuration.

. Drag the relevant time band, such as hour, day, or month to go to the time you want to see.
+
NOTE: Some timelines, such as *Events Operations: All Events*, use minutes, hours, and days instead of going back only 30 days.
. To see more detail for a resource in the timeline, click on it.
  A balloon appears with a clickable link to the resource.
